    "section": "",
    "text": "Key Takeaways:\n\nEvaluation is critical: It drives the iterative process of improving your LLM application, enabling you to make informed decisions about prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and model selection.\nDon’t overcomplicate things: Start simple with unit tests and focus on practical metrics that align with your specific use case. Avoid building overly complex evaluation frameworks prematurely.\nHuman judgment is still essential: While LMs can assist with evaluation, human experts are ultimately responsible for defining what constitutes good performance and aligning the LLM to those preferences.\nLook at your data: Regularly examine the inputs and outputs of your LLM system, as well as production data, to identify failure modes, refine evaluation criteria, and ensure the system is behaving as intended.\nEvaluation is iterative: Both evaluation criteria and the methods for evaluating those criteria will evolve as you learn more about the task and gather more data. Be prepared to adapt and refine your evaluation process over time.\n\n\n\nInsights:\n\nTraditional ML evaluation principles still apply: Leverage existing evaluation techniques and adapt them to the nuances of LLMs. Don’t treat LLM evaluation as an entirely new field.\nUse case experts are invaluable: Involve them in the evaluation process from the beginning to ensure alignment between evaluation metrics and user needs.\nLM-assisted evaluation is not a silver bullet: While helpful for scaling evaluations and providing directional insights, it requires careful and methodical application. Multiple judges, models, and shots should be used, and human alignment should be checked regularly.\nProduction endpoints are key: Evaluating directly against production endpoints minimizes drift and ensures consistency between development and production environments.\n\n\n\nAction Items:\n\nImplement unit tests: Identify and codify basic sanity checks for your LLM application to catch common errors.\nStart logging traces: Use existing tools like LangSmith, Braintrust, or Instruct to capture the inputs and outputs of your LLM pipeline for detailed analysis and debugging.\nDevelop a simple evaluation framework: Focus on key metrics relevant to your use case, and build the framework iteratively as you gain more experience and data.\nInvolve use case experts: Work with them to define evaluation criteria, review outputs, and provide feedback on the evaluation process.\nExplore LLM-assisted evaluation: Experiment with tools and techniques that leverage LLMs to scale your evaluation efforts, but do so with a critical eye and ensure human alignment.\n\n\n\nOther Interesting Information:\n\nSeveral tools and resources for LLM evaluation were mentioned, including LangSmith, Braintrust, Weights & Biases, Instruct, Identic.Logfire, Weave, OpenTelemetry, and a book on recommendation systems by Brian Bishop.\nA research prototype interface called EvalGen was presented, which assists developers in creating and iterating on LLM evaluations in a more intuitive and user-friendly way.\nThe talk emphasized the importance of minimizing wait time in the evaluation process by involving humans in the loop for tasks like editing criteria, refining criteria, and interactively grading LLM outputs."

    "text": "Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Language Modeling\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12561\nRecent multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-image and image-to-text generation. However, these models store all learned knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant text and images fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., documents on the web). Specifically, for the retriever, we use a pretrained CLIP, and for the generator, we train a CM3 Transformer on the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate both text and images. We show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MS-COCO), while requiring much less compute for training (&lt;30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show that RA-CM3 exhibits novel capabilities, such as faithful image generation and multimodal in-context learning (e.g., image generation from demonstrations).\n\nDevelop a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, a first of it’s kind\nThe generator uses retrieved items for generation too\nRetrieval augmented training - helped a lot"

By harnessing the power of these models, the proposed approach generates diverse utterances based on user goals and limited dialog examples. Unlike traditional simulators, this method eliminates the need for labor-intensive rule definition or extensive annotated data, making it more efficient and accessible. Additionally, an error analysis of the interaction between the user simulator and dialog system uncovers common mistakes, providing valuable insights into areas that require improvement. Our implementation is available at this https URL.\n\nRule based systems are still more accurate. However they mainly understand happy paths of a dialog system.\nThese LLM based approaches can explore unexpected behavior of users"

    "text": "Challenges in post-training quantization of Vision Transformers\nPaper: https://research.ibm.com/publications/challenges-in-post-training-quantization-of-vision-transformers\nVision Transformers recently showed outstanding performance in computer vision tasks. However, those models are compute and memory intensive that require accelerators with a large amount of memory like NVIDIA A100 graphic processing unit for training and even for inference. Post-training quantization is an appealing compression method, as it does not require retraining the models and labels to tune the model. In this paper, we look in depth at multiple models in terms of size, architecture, and training procedure and provide guidelines on how to quantize the model to an 8-bit integer, both weights and activations. We perform a well-rounded study on the effects of quantization and sensitivity to the quantization error. Moreover, we show that applying mixed-data precision quantization works well for most vision transformer models achieving up to 90% compression ratio within a 2% top-1 accuracy drop. This kind of quantization offers a trade-off between memory, compute, and performance of the models that are deployable with the current software and hardware stack.\n\nThere’s a difference between Static vs Dynamic Quantization\nLarger models are supposed to be easier to quantize, but not the case here\nSignal to noise quantization ratio - SNQR\nPartial Quantization: Some models that lost accuracy during dynamic quant, regained during 90% quant"

    "text": "Generalization in Graph Neural Networks: Improved PAC-Bayesian Bounds on Graph Diffusion\nPaper: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/ju23a/ju23a.pdf\nGraph neural networks are widely used tools for graph prediction tasks. Motivated by their empirical performance, prior works have developed generalization bounds for graph neural networks, which scale with graph structures in terms of the maximum degree. In this paper, we present generalization bounds that instead scale with the largest singular value of the graph neural network’s feature diffusion matrix. These bounds are numerically much smaller than prior bounds for real-world graphs. We also construct a lower bound of the generalization gap that matches our upper bound asymptotically. To achieve these results, we analyze a unified model that includes prior works’ settings (i.e., convolutional and message-passing networks) and new settings (i.e., graph isomorphism networks). Our key idea is to measure the stability of graph neural networks against noise perturbations using Hessians. Empirically, we find that Hessian-based measurements correlate with observed generalization gaps of graph neural networks accurately; Optimizing noise stability properties for fine-tuning pretrained graph neural networks also improves the test performance on several graph-level classification tasks.\n\nOverfitting if there’s an imbalance between pretraining data and finetuning data size\nGeneralization gap\n\nNot just cross validation loss\nMore detailed understanding - what networks are causing the overfitting\nGeneralization gap - measures the gap between training/test losses"

However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna’s testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills. Even though WizardLM still lags behind ChatGPT in some aspects, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with AI-evolved instructions is a promising direction for enhancing LLMs. Our code and data are public at this https URL\nVerify and Edit CoT - Self-consistency\nKnowledge adapting framework\nLanguage diversity prompting\nStandard vs Personalized Distillation from LLMs"

While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable ability in achieving high-quality annotation in various tasks, the key to applying this ability to specific tasks lies in developing high-quality prompts. Thus we propose a framework to inherit the merits of both in-context learning and zero-shot learning by incorporating enriched instructions derived from input-output demonstrations to optimize original prompt. We refer to the enrichment as the Hint and propose a framework to automatically generate the hint from labeled data. More concretely, starting from an initial prompt, our method first instructs a LLM to deduce new hints for selected samples from incorrect predictions, and then summarizes from per-sample hints and adds the results back to the initial prompt to form a new, enriched instruction. The proposed method is evaluated on the BIG-Bench Instruction Induction dataset for both zero-shot and few-short prompts, where experiments demonstrate our method is able to significantly boost accuracy for multiple tasks"

Street argues against contemporary societal views that undermine the permanence and sanctity of marriage, using Scripture to support his points.\nThroughout the seminar, Street uses biblical passages, particularly from Genesis, to illustrate God’s intentions for marriage. He contrasts these with modern concepts like trial marriages and robotic companions, arguing that these deviate from God’s design. The seminar emphasizes the importance of commitment over feelings, the permanence of the marital relationship compared to the temporary nature of the parent-child relationship, and the concept of “becoming one flesh” in all aspects of life.\nStreet’s approach to marriage is deeply rooted in biblical teaching, presenting a conservative, traditional view of marital roles and purposes. He challenges modern cultural norms and encourages couples to base their marriages on God’s design rather than societal trends or personal desires."

The central message emphasizes that sex is a pure, holy, and God-designed aspect of marriage, intended for mutual satisfaction and enjoyment between spouses. Street argues against both extremes of viewing sex as dirty or taboo and seeing it as the highest form of human relationship.\nThroughout the seminar, Street uses biblical passages to support his main points, drawing primarily from 1 Corinthians 7, Proverbs 5, and other relevant verses. He emphasizes that the Bible presents sex as a good gift from God, but one that should be expressed exclusively within the confines of a heterosexual, monogamous marriage. The arguments and verses are used to reinforce the idea that sexual intimacy in marriage should be characterized by mutual giving, equal rights and responsibilities, and regular engagement.\nStreet’s approach to marriage and sexuality is deeply rooted in biblical principles, challenging cultural norms and encouraging couples to view their sexual relationship as a ministry to each other. He stresses the importance of putting one’s spouse’s needs and satisfaction above personal gratification, presenting this as a reflection of Christ-like love and service within marriage."

    "title": "State of GPT - Andrej Karpathy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Andrej Karpathy gave a talk at a Microsoft conference in late May about the State of GPT: \nHere are some things I learned:\n\n\n\nGPT Assistant Pipeline\n\n\nIt was helpful to see the different stages that training a RLHF-tuned LLM goes through from 1) pretraining, 2) supervised fine-tuning, 3) reward modeling and 4) reinforcement learning.\n\n\n\nBase Models can be Prompted\n\n\nI wasn’t following the literature back then in the era of GPT-2 but it’s interesting to see the different types of prompts that people were trying to get base models to behave like assistants. With ChatGPT now, these types of prompts are not as useful.\n\n\n\nSupervised Fine-tuning Dataset\n\n\nI didn’t realize that these datasets took so much effort to create. A lot of times these contractors are writing long form answers to questions, adhering to very complex labeling instructions to be “helpful, truthful, harmless” taking sometimes hours to write these!\n\n\n\nReward Modeling Training\n\n\nBinary classification between prompt and completion pairs. The completion yellow tokens are coming from the SFT model. Only supervise the training of the Transformer at the green reward token. The transformer will learn to predict the reward token for a given prompt/completion pair. We have the ground truth rewards from our human labelers. As the model is trained it can then better predict the reward tokens.\n\n\n\nReinforcement Learning Training\n\n\nTaking the reward model from the previous stage, we take the tuples of (prompt, completion, reward), the completions are coming from the SFT model (model we want to train), the reward is from the reward model. The rewards are fixed.\nWe train on the yellow tokens and weigh the language model object by the reward. For example, in the first row, the reward is high so we increase the probabilities of those words appearing.\n\n\n\nRLHF vs SFT\n\n\nThe difference between SFT (supervised fine tuning) and RLHF (reinforcement learning human feedback) LLMs. It’s interesting that the InstructGPT paper showed that humans prefer RLHF models to SFT models.\n\n\n\nWhy RLHF?\n\n\nWhy does RLHF work better than SFT? Karpathy offers up an interesting hypothesis basically saying that it is easier for humans to compare two completions (what one does when creating training data for the reward model) vs. creating a completion from scratch (what one does when creating training data for the SFT model). The example being if the prompt is “Write a haiku about paperclips” - it’s much easier to compare two haikus about paper clips than to write a haiku about paper clips from scratch.\n\n\n\nMode collapse\n\n\nOne downside of fine-tuned models I didn’t realize was they lose entropy, in other words fine-tune models often predict one token with high probability instead of a nice distribution of tokens. So base models can be better at tasks where you have N examples of things want to generate more things. Karpathy’s toy example was prompting with “Here are 100 cool pokemon names I made up:” and giving it 7 actual Pokemon and the base model completes with additional generated Pokemon names.\n\n\n\nAssistant Leaderboard\n\n\nA team at Berkeley has assembled Elo ratings from some assistant LLMs. The first 3 are RLHF models, the rest of SFT models. GPT-4 is winning. A link to a more up-to-date version of the leaderboard with Google’s PaLM2: https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-25-leaderboard/ which is still pretty far between GPT3.5 and GPT-4.\n \n\nAll of the internal monologue is stripped away in the text LLMs train on\nThey spend the ~same amount of compute on every token =&gt; LLMs don’t reproduce this behavior by default!\nThey don’t know what they don’t know, they imitate the next token\nThey don’t know what they are good at or not, they imitate the next token They don’t reflect. They don’t sanity check. They don’t correct their mistakes along the way\nThey don’t have a separate “inner monologue stream in their head”\nThey do have very large fact-based knowledge across a vast number of areas\nThey do have a large and ~perfect “working memory” (their context window)\n\nPrompting is a way of making of for the cognitive difference between these two architectures (human brains vs. LLMs).\n\n\n\nChain of Thought\n\n\nModels need tokens to think. By breaking up a task into multiple steps, you are giving the language model an opportunity to think and reason over more tokens.\n\n\n\nCondition on Good Performance\n\n\nBecause language models are trained on all kinds of data, e.g. student solutions to a physics problem or an expert solution to the same problem, you can prompt the model “to be an expert in physics” and that usually improves performance. Apparently the best prompt was “Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.”\n\n\n\nRetrieval-Augmented LLMs\n\n\n\nBreak up relevant documents into chunks\nUse embedding APIs to index chunks into a vector store\nGiven a test-time query, retrieve related information\nOrganize the information into the prompt\n\n\n\n\nFinetuning\n\n\nBecome more accessible to fine-tuning a model:\n\nParameter Efficient Finetuning, e.g. LoRA - only trainng small sparse pieces of your model\nLow-precision inference, e.g. bitsandbytes\nOpen source high quality models like LLaMA\n\n\n\n\nDefault Recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\nUse cases"

    "section": "General tips for effective prompting",
    "text": "General tips for effective prompting\n\n1. Be clear and specific\n\nClearly state your task or question at the beginning of your message.\nProvide context and details to help Claude understand your needs.\nBreak complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nBad prompt:  “Help me with a presentation.” \nGood prompt:  “I need help creating a 10-slide presentation for our quarterly sales meeting. The presentation should cover our Q2 sales performance, top-selling products, and sales targets for Q3. Please provide an outline with key points for each slide.” \nWhy it’s better: The good prompt provides specific details about the task, including the number of slides, the purpose of the presentation, and the key topics to be covered.\n\n\n2. Use examples\n\nProvide examples of the kind of output you’re looking for.\nIf you want a specific format or style, show Claude an example.\n\nBad prompt:  “Write a professional email.” \nGood prompt:  “I need to write a professional email to a client about a project delay. Here’s a similar email I’ve sent before:\n‘Dear [Client], I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the progress of [Project Name]. Unfortunately, we’ve encountered an unexpected issue that will delay our completion date by approximately two weeks. We’re working diligently to resolve this and will keep you updated on our progress. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Best regards, [Your Name]’\nHelp me draft a new email following a similar tone and structure, but for our current situation where we’re delayed by a month due to supply chain issues.” \nWhy it’s better: The good prompt provides a concrete example of the desired style and tone, giving Claude a clear reference point for the new email.\n\n\n3. Encourage thinking\n\nFor complex tasks, ask Claude to “think step-by-step” or “explain your reasoning.”\nThis can lead to more accurate and detailed responses.\n\nBad prompt:  “How can I improve team productivity?” \nGood prompt:  “I’m looking to improve my team’s productivity. Think through this step-by-step, considering the following factors: 1. Current productivity blockers (e.g., too many meetings, unclear priorities) 2. Potential solutions (e.g., time management techniques, project management tools) 3. Implementation challenges 4. Methods to measure improvement\nFor each step, please provide a brief explanation of your reasoning. Then summarize your ideas at the end.” \nWhy it’s better: The good prompt asks Claude to think through the problem systematically, providing a guided structure for the response and asking for explanations of the reasoning process. It also prompts Claude to create a summary at the end for easier reading.\n\n\n4. Iterative refinement\n\nIf Claude’s first response isn’t quite right, ask for clarifications or modifications.\nYou can always say “That’s close, but can you adjust X to be more like Y?”\n\nBad prompt:  “Make it better.” \nGood prompt:  “That’s a good start, but please refine it further. Make the following adjustments: 1. Make the tone more casual and friendly 2. Add a specific example of how our product has helped a customer 3. Shorten the second paragraph to focus more on the benefits rather than the features” \nWhy it’s better: The good prompt provides specific feedback and clear instructions for improvements, allowing Claude to make targeted adjustments instead of just relying on Claude’s innate sense of what “better” might be — which is likely different from the user’s definition!\n\n\n5. Leverage Claude’s knowledge\n\nClaude has broad knowledge across many fields. Don’t hesitate to ask for explanations or background information\nBe sure to include relevant context and details so that Claude’s response is maximally targeted to be helpful\n\nBad prompt:  “What is marketing? How do I do it?” \nGood prompt:  “I’m developing a marketing strategy for a new eco-friendly cleaning product line. Can you provide an overview of current trends in green marketing? Please include: 1. Key messaging strategies that resonate with environmentally conscious consumers 2. Effective channels for reaching this audience 3. Examples of successful green marketing campaigns from the past year 4. Potential pitfalls to avoid (e.g., greenwashing accusations)\nThis information will help me shape our marketing approach.” \nWhy it’s better: The good prompt asks for specific, contextually relevant information that leverages Claude’s broad knowledge base. It provides context for how the information will be used, which helps Claude frame its answer in the most relevant way.\n\n\n6. Use role-playing\n\nAsk Claude to adopt a specific role or perspective when responding.\n\nBad prompt:  “Help me prepare for a negotiation.” \nGood prompt:  “You are a fabric supplier for my backpack manufacturing company. I’m preparing for a negotiation with this supplier to reduce prices by 10%. As the supplier, please provide: 1. Three potential objections to our request for a price reduction 2. For each objection, suggest a counterargument from my perspective 3. Two alternative proposals the supplier might offer instead of a straight price cut\nThen, switch roles and provide advice on how I, as the buyer, can best approach this negotiation to achieve our goal.” \nWhy it’s better: This prompt uses role-playing to explore multiple perspectives of the negotiation, providing a more comprehensive preparation. Role-playing also encourages Claude to more readily adopt the nuances of specific perspectives, increasing the intelligence and performance of Claude’s response."

The description should:\n\nHighlight the chair’s key ergonomic features\nExplain how these features benefit the user’s health and productivity\nInclude a brief mention of the sustainable materials used\nEnd with a call-to-action encouraging readers to try the chair\n\nAim for about 200 words.” \nWhy it’s better: This prompt provides clear guidance on the tone, style, and specific elements to include in the product description.\nDefine output structure\n\nProvide a basic outline or list of points you want covered.\n\nBad prompt:  “Create a presentation on our company results.” \nGood prompt:  “I need to create a presentation on our Q2 results. Structure this with the following sections:\n\nOverview\nSales Performance\nCustomer Acquisition\nChallenges\nQ3 Outlook\n\nFor each section, suggest 3-4 key points to cover, based on typical business presentations. Also, recommend one type of data visualization (e.g., graph, chart) that would be effective for each section.” \nWhy it’s better: This prompt provides a clear structure and asks for specific elements (key points and data visualizations) for each section.\n\n\n\nDocument summary and Q&A\n\nBe specific about what you want\n\nAsk for a summary of specific aspects or sections of the document.\nFrame your questions clearly and directly.\nBe sure to specify what kind of summary (output structure, content type) you want\n\nUse the document names\n\nRefer to attached documents by name.\n\nAsk for citations\n\nRequest that Claude cites specific parts of the document in its answers.\n\n\nHere is an example that combines all three of the above techniques:\nBad prompt:  “Summarize this report for me.” \nGood prompt:  “I’ve attached a 50-page market research report called ‘Tech Industry Trends 2023’. Can you provide a 2-paragraph summary focusing on AI and machine learning trends? Then, please answer these questions: 1. What are the top 3 AI applications in business for this year? 2. How is machine learning impacting job roles in the tech industry? 3. What potential risks or challenges does the report mention regarding AI adoption?\nPlease cite specific sections or page numbers when answering these questions.” \nWhy it’s better: This prompt specifies the exact focus of the summary, provides specific questions, and asks for citations, ensuring a more targeted and useful response. It also indicates the ideal summary output structure, such as limiting the response to 2 paragraphs.\n\n\nData analysis and visualization\n\nSpecify the desired format\n\nClearly describe the format you want the data in.\n\nBad prompt:  “Analyze our sales data.” \nGood prompt:  “I’ve attached a spreadsheet called ‘Sales Data 2023’. Can you analyze this data and present the key findings in the following format:\n\nExecutive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nKey Metrics:\n\nTotal sales for each quarter\nTop-performing product category\nHighest growth region\n\nTrends:\n\nList 3 notable trends, each with a brief explanation\n\nRecommendations:\n\nProvide 3 data-driven recommendations, each with a brief rationale\n\n\nAfter the analysis, suggest three types of data visualizations that would effectively communicate these findings.” \nWhy it’s better: This prompt provides a clear structure for the analysis, specifies key metrics to focus on, and asks for recommendations and visualization suggestions for further formatting.\n\n\n\nBrainstorming\n\nUse Claude to generate ideas by asking for a list of possibilities or alternatives.\n\nBe specific about what topics you want Claude to cover in its brainstorming\n\n\nBad prompt:  “Give me some team-building ideas.” \nGood prompt:  “We need to come up with team-building activities for our remote team of 20 people. Can you help me brainstorm by: 1. Suggesting 10 virtual team-building activities that promote collaboration 2. For each activity, briefly explain how it fosters teamwork 3. Indicate which activities are best for: a) Ice-breakers b) Improving communication c) Problem-solving skills 4. Suggest one low-cost option and one premium option.” \nWhy it’s better: This prompt provides specific parameters for the brainstorming session, including the number of ideas, type of activities, and additional categorization, resulting in a more structured and useful output.\n\nRequest responses in specific formats like bullet points, numbered lists, or tables for easier reading.\nBad Prompt:  “Compare project management software options.” \nGood Prompt:  “We’re considering three different project management software options: Asana, Trello, and Microsoft Project. Can you compare these in a table format using the following criteria:\n\nKey Features\nEase of Use\nScalability\nPricing (include specific plans if possible)\nIntegration capabilities\nBest suited for (e.g., small teams, enterprise, specific industries)” \n\nWhy it’s better: This prompt requests a specific structure (table) for the comparison, provides clear criteria, making the information easy to understand and apply."

Please provide a detailed strategy that includes:\n\nMarket Analysis:\n\nCurrent trends in eco-friendly tech accessories\n2-3 key competitors and their strategies\nPotential market size and growth projections\n\nTarget Audience Persona:\n\nDetailed description of our ideal customer\nTheir pain points and how our products solve them\n\nMarketing Mix:\n\nProduct: Key features to highlight\nPrice: Suggested pricing strategy with rationale\nPlace: Recommended distribution channels\nPromotion:\n\n5 marketing channels to focus on, with pros and cons for each\n3 creative campaign ideas for launch\n\n\nContent Strategy:\n\n5 content themes that would resonate with our audience\nSuggested content types (e.g., blog posts, videos, infographics)\n\nKPIs and Measurement:\n\n5 key metrics to track\nSuggested tools for measuring these metrics\n\n\nPlease present this information in a structured format with headings and bullet points. Where relevant, explain your reasoning or provide brief examples.\nAfter outlining the strategy, please identify any potential challenges or risks we should be aware of, and suggest mitigation strategies for each.” \nWhy it’s better: This prompt combines multiple techniques including role assignment, specific task breakdown, structured output request, brainstorming (for campaign ideas and content themes), and asking for explanations. It provides clear guidelines while allowing room for Claude’s analysis and creativity.\n\n\nExample 2: Financial report analysis\nBad prompt:  “Analyze this financial report.” \nGood prompt:  “I’ve attached our company’s Q2 financial report titled ‘Q2_2023_Financial_Report.pdf’. Act as a seasoned CFO and analyze this report and prepare a briefing for our board of directors. Please structure your analysis as follows:\n\nExecutive Summary (3-4 sentences highlighting key points)\nFinancial Performance Overview:\n\nRevenue: Compare to previous quarter and same quarter last year\nProfit margins: Gross and Net, with explanations for any significant changes\nCash flow: Highlight any concerns or positive developments\n\nKey Performance Indicators:\n\nList our top 5 KPIs and their current status (Use a table format)\nFor each KPI, provide a brief explanation of its significance and any notable trends\n\nSegment Analysis:\n\nBreak down performance by our three main business segments\nIdentify the best and worst performing segments, with potential reasons for their performance\n\nBalance Sheet Review:\n\nHighlight any significant changes in assets, liabilities, or equity\nCalculate and interpret key ratios (e.g., current ratio, debt-to-equity)\n\nForward-Looking Statements:\n\nBased on this data, provide 3 key predictions for Q3\nSuggest 2-3 strategic moves we should consider to improve our financial position\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\nIdentify 3 potential financial risks based on this report\nPropose mitigation strategies for each risk\n\nPeer Comparison:\n\nCompare our performance to 2-3 key competitors (use publicly available data)\nHighlight areas where we’re outperforming and areas for improvement\n\n\nPlease use charts or tables where appropriate to visualize data. For any assumptions or interpretations you make, please clearly state them and provide your reasoning.\nAfter completing the analysis, please generate 5 potential questions that board members might ask about this report, along with suggested responses.\nFinally, summarize this entire analysis into a single paragraph that I can use as an opening statement in the board meeting.” \nWhy it’s better: This prompt combines role-playing (as CFO), structured output, specific data analysis requests, predictive analysis, risk assessment, comparative analysis, and even anticipates follow-up questions. It provides a clear framework while encouraging deep analysis and strategic thinking."

BERT can be used in Bi-Encoders and Cross-Encoders. This post from sbert explains it quite well.\n\n\n\nCross Encoders\n\n\n\nBi-Encoders produce an embedding for each input sentence. So for two sentences, two embeddings are produced and these can be compared using cosine similarity.\nWith Cross-Encoders, both input sentences are passed at the same time to the Transformer, it produces not an embedding but a value between 0 and 1 that represents the similarity between the two sentences.\nCross-Encoders achieve better performance than Bi-Encoders but for many large scale information retrieval applications they are not practical because since embeddings are not produced, there is no way to index the data and retrieve it efficiently.\nFrom the above post: “Bi-Encoders are used whenever you need a sentence embedding in a vector space for efficient comparison. Applications are for example Information Retrieval / Semantic Search or Clustering. Cross-Encoders would be the wrong choice for these application: Clustering 10,000 sentence with CrossEncoders would require computing similarity scores for about 50 Million sentence combinations, which takes about 65 hours. With a Bi-Encoder, you compute the embedding for each sentence, which takes only 5 seconds. You can then perform the clustering.”\nYou can combine Bi-Encoders and Cross-Encoders. Use Bi-Encoders to retrieve the top-k documents and then use Cross-Encoders to re-rank the top-k documents. An example for this common retrieve and re-rank strategy is here."

    "title": "Running Llama2 Locally on a M1 Mac",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Llama2\nLlama2 was released by Meta 2 days ago. See the:\n\nblog post\ntechnical paper\n\nNathan Lambert has a nice writeup of his thoughts on the model. And AI Explained has a nice video breakdown.\n\n\nRunning Llama2 locally on a Mac\nI saw this tweet yesterday about running the model locally on a M1 mac and tried it. The instructions are just in this gist and it was trivial to setup. The below script uses the llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin model file but you can find other versions of the llama2-13-chat model on Huggingface here. It’s truly amazing how quickly new model releases get ported over to llama.cpp and quantized (1-2 days).\n# Clone llama.cpp\ngit clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git\ncd llama.cpp\n\n# Build it\nLLAMA_METAL=1 make\n\n# Download model\nexport MODEL=llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin\nwget \"https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GGML/resolve/main/${MODEL}\"\n\n# Run\necho \"Prompt: \" \\\n    && read PROMPT \\\n    && ./main \\\n        -t 8 \\\n        -ngl 1 \\\n        -m ${MODEL} \\\n        --color \\\n        -c 2048 \\\n        --temp 0.7 \\\n        --repeat_penalty 1.1 \\\n        -n -1 \\\n        -p \"[INST] ${PROMPT} [/INST]\"\n\n\nResults\nThis is the first time I’ve ever run an LLM locally using the GPU on my Mac! One prompt I tried was “What’s the difference between data science and data engineering?” Getting about 15 tokens a second and the answer was quite good:\n\n\n\nLlama2: Data Science vs Data Engineering\n\n\nAnother prompt I tried was, “What’s the meaning of life”, not because I was necessarily wondering what llama2 thought the meaning of life was, but because I had read a paper earlier in the day called Generative Language Models and Automated Influence Operations: Emerging Threats and Potential Mitigations. One of the tables in the paper showed the progress language models have made over the years and the prompt used to showcae this was “What is the meaning of life?”\n\n\n\nMeaning of Life Progress in Language Models\n\n\nThe progress from 2011 to 2020 was meaningful. But the progress from 2020 to 2023 is also quite impressive. Here is what llama2 had to say for the same prompt:\n\n\n\nLlama2: Meaning of Life\n\n\nThe model also is able to give strong answers by modifying the previous prompt asking it to wear different hats as a Christian or a Muslim:\n\nAs a Christian, what is the meaning of life?\nAs a Muslim, what is the maning of life?\n\n\n\n\nLlama2: Meaning of Life for a Christian\n\n\n\n\n\nLlama2: Meaning of Life for a Muslim\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of a Language Model Locally\nRunning a language model locally can have several benefits compared to using a cloud-based service. Here are some of the advantages of running a language model locally:\n\nControl and customization: When you run a language model locally, you have complete control over the model and its behavior. You can customize the model to fit your specific needs and requirements, which may not be possible with a cloud-based service.\nPrivacy and security: By running the model locally, you can keep your data and models private and secure. You don’t have to worry about sensitive information being transmitted over the internet or stored on external servers.\nFaster response times: Local models can respond faster than cloud-based services because they don’t require network latency. This is particularly important for applications that require real-time responses, such as chatbots or voice assistants.\nOffline capabilities: With a local language model, you can still use the model even when you don’t have internet access. This is useful for applications that need to work offline or in areas with limited connectivity.\nCost-effective: Running a language model locally can be more cost-effective than using a cloud-based service, especially for large-scale deployments. You don’t have to pay for network bandwidth, data storage, or other cloud-based services.\nBetter performance: Depending on the specific use case, a local language model may perform better than a cloud-based service. This is because you can optimize the model and hardware for your specific use case, which may not be possible with a cloud-based service.\nMore flexibility: With a local language model, you have more flexibility to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies. You can also more easily integrate the model with other systems and applications.\nBetter understanding of data: When you run a language model locally, you have more visibility into your data and how it’s being processed. This can help you better understand your data and improve your model’s performance.\nImproved explainability: Local language models can provide more explainability than cloud-based services. You can see exactly how the model is processing your data and make changes to improve its transparency and accountability.\nBetter integration with other systems: When you run a language model locally, it’s easier to integrate with other systems and applications. You can customize the model to fit your specific needs and requirements, which may not be possible with a cloud-based service.\n\nOverall, running a language model locally can provide several benefits, including control, privacy, faster response times, offline capabilities, cost-effectiveness, better performance, more flexibility, better understanding of data, improved explainability, and better integration with other systems. However, it’s important to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between local and cloud-based models based on your specific use case and requirements.\nNote the above was generated by llama2.\n\n\nAsitop\nYou can also use this library asitop to monitor your GPU locally on a Mac.\n\n\n\nAsitop\n\n\n\n\nllama.cpp output\nRunning this in a terminal produces a bunch of llama.cpp

Here are the steps I took to reproduce what Hamel did:\nThe class gave us $200 of Jarvislabs credits so I spun up a VM using the Axolotl template. I picked an RTX5000 with 16GB VRAM 1x A100 with 100GB of disk space. The default 20GB of disk space is not enough as the base models take 5-10GB of space each.\nI cloned the repo:\nI logged into Weights and Biases:\nI logged into Huggingface.

    "text": "Step 2: Summarize\nI took the above prompt and transcript data to generate a summary of the conference talk. I did have to instruct the LLM to return the output in “pastable markdown.”\n\n\n\nSummary of Q&A\n\n\nThe markdown genrated by Claude is below:\n# Biblical Counseling Q&A Session Summary\n\n## [Q1: How can I get training in true biblical counseling?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=101s)\n\nDr. Street recommends several options:\n1. Get an accredited graduate degree in biblical counseling for in-depth study.\n2. Attend training sessions offered by the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors (ACBC).\n3. Look for undergraduate programs in biblical counseling at schools like Boyce College or The Master's University.\n4. Attend seminars and workshops on biblical counseling.\n\nHe emphasizes the importance of ensuring the training adheres to true biblical counseling standards, which can be verified by checking the ACBC website (biblicalcounseling.com) for their statement of faith and practice.\n\n## [Q2: How do we deal with past hurts, pains, difficulties and abuse?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=371s)\n\nDr. Street provides the following guidance:\n1. Understand that we live in a sinful world where bad things happen.\n2. Choose whether to let past traumas define you or allow Christ to define you.\n3. Focus on doing good and not repaying evil with evil.\n4. Seek peace and pursue righteousness.\n5. Be prepared to explain your faith and hope to others who notice your changed behavior.\n\nHe emphasizes that while traumatic experiences are real, Christians should not let them control their lives, but instead find their identity in Christ.\n\n## [Q3: At what age do you encourage children to move out of the home?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=748s)\n\nDr. Street provides the following guidelines:\n1. There's no specific age, as individual circumstances (like disabilities) may affect this decision.\n2. Children should be raised with the expectation of eventually leaving home.\n3. Parents should encourage independence when children are physically and mentally capable of supporting themselves.\n4. For adult children living at home, parents can implement strategies like charging rent to encourage moving out.\n5. Parents should act as a safety net but not enable prolonged dependence.\n\n## [Q4: What do you say to couples living together prior to marriage?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=977s)\n\nDr. Street strongly advises against cohabitation before marriage:\n1. He states that couples living together before marriage are \"living openly in sin.\"\n2. He emphasizes that Christians should be different from worldly practices.\n3. He advises couples to stop cohabiting, repent, and ask each other for forgiveness.\n4. He explains that sexual relationships should only occur within a monogamous, heterosexual marriage.\n5. He warns that premarital cohabitation can undermine trust and integrity in the future marriage.\n\n## [Q5: What do Christian parents do when an unmarried couple want to spend the night together in their home?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=1166s)\n\nDr. Street advises:\n1. Parents should not allow unmarried couples to share a room in their home.\n2. They should make separate sleeping arrangements, even if it means parents sleeping separately to accommodate guests.\n3. Parents shouldn't compromise their principles to accommodate others' ungodliness.\n4. While parents can express love in other ways, they shouldn't enable or approve of sinful behavior.\n5. This applies to all unmarried couples, regardless of sexual orientation.\n\n## [Q6: How do we help young men and women who are not married but want to become married?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=1353s)\n\nDr. Street references 1 Thessalonians 4:3-7 and advises:\n1. Teach them to choose a spouse based on holiness and honor, not primarily on physical attraction.\n2. Encourage them to consider whether their relationship leads to greater holiness for both partners.\n3. Help them understand the importance of honoring parents' wisdom in choosing a spouse.\n4. Prepare them for the reality that they're marrying someone with flaws, not the idealized version they see while dating.\n\n## [Q7: What role do godly parents play in encouraging their children into a godly marriage?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=1670s)\n\nDr. Street suggests:\n1. Parents should teach their children what Scripture says about marriage.\n2. They should guide their children in making decisions about marriage in an honorable and godly way.\n3. Parents often have wisdom that younger people lack, even if the parents aren't believers.\n4. Children should pay close attention to their parents' input about potential spouses.\n5. Parents should help their children realize they're marrying someone with flaws, not a perfect person.\n\n## [Q8: Should married couples live with their in-laws?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=1917s)\n\nDr. Street provides the following guidance:\n1. There's no simple yes or no answer, as circumstances vary.\n2. Living with in-laws can be necessary for caregiving or financial reasons.\n3. Generally, it's not the best arrangement for newly married couples.\n4. If couples do live with in-laws, it's crucial to maintain proper boundaries and priorities.\n5. The married couple must present a unified front and prioritize their relationship over parental relationships.\n6. The husband and wife should always side with each other, not their respective parents.\n\n## [Q9: How do I make my husband a priority when I have a career?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=2164s)\n\nDr. Street advises:\n1. It's not wrong for a woman to have a career, but it shouldn't dictate family priorities.\n2. A woman's primary responsibility should be to her husband, children, and home, not her career.\n3. Husbands should take leadership in providing for the family financially.\n4. Both spouses should work together to balance career and home responsibilities.\n5. Husbands should actively help with household tasks, especially if both spouses work outside the home.\n\n## [Q10: Can I have a calling at work as a woman?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=2470s)\n\nDr. Street states:\n1. There is no special \"calling\" for women in careers in the same way as pastoral ministry.\n2. Women can have successful careers and be well-accomplished professionally.\n3. Careers can be used in good and godly ways, including in Christian service.\n4. However, a woman's home and husband should always be her top priority.\n5. Women should ensure their career doesn't overshadow their primary responsibilities to family and home.\n\n## [Q11: What are some basic principles to apply if a Christian is married to a non-Christian?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=2674s)\n\nDr. Street provides the following guidance based on 1 Peter 3:\n1. For wives with unbelieving husbands, follow 1 Peter 3:1-6 as your guide.\n2. For husbands with unbelieving wives, follow 1 Peter 3:7.\n3. Focus on unity with other Christians, sympathy, love, and humility.\n4. Don't repay evil with evil, but bless others instead.\n5. Seek peace and pursue righteousness.\n6. Be prepared to explain your faith when your spouse asks about your changed behavior.\n7. View yourself as God's missionary to your unbelieving spouse.\n8. Live out your faith consistently, even in the face of difficulties.\n\n## Main Themes of the Q&A Session:\n\n1. Biblical approach to counseling and dealing with past traumas\n2. Christian perspectives on marriage, cohabitation, and family life\n3. Balancing career and family responsibilities, especially for women\n4. Parenting adult children and encouraging independence\n5. Navigating relationships with in-laws\n6. Guidance for Christians married to non-believers\n7. The importance of maintaining biblical standards in a secular culture\n\nThe session emphasizes a strong commitment to biblical principles in all aspects of life, particularly in marriage and family relationships. It also stresses the importance of distinctively Christian behavior in contrast to worldly practices."

    "title": "Large Language Models, Work and the Future of Jobs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last month, Allen Downey showcased the power of ChatGPT by using it to solve every problem in his Think Python books. As a result, he encouraged everyone who writes code to use LLM-assistance in their development. This inspired me to further explore the capabilities of GPT-4 and its potential effects on work and productivity.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are already transforming the way we work. Even in my work as a data scientist, ChatGPT (actually GPT-4) has dramatically affected how I work and my daily tasks. Just a quick listing out of some of the prompts I’ve sent to GPT-4 in the last month:\n\nExtracting features from pairs of resumes and job descriptions in JSON\nCopy pasted a Linux error OSError: [Errno 28] inotify watch limit reached and GPT-4 explained what the error was and how to fix it (unprompted)\nWhat factors to consider what going from a individual contributor to a manager role\nCopy pasted a SQL query to debug it\nHow to make a tensor of 0’s of a data type Long and Int\nIn PyTorch what does batch_first=False do?\nHelp writing a MLOps Python wrapper package that wraps Vertex AI Pipelines\nCopy and pasted\n\n187 packages can be updated.\n27 updates are security updates.\nAnd it responded with commands for how to update package lists, upgrade packages and do a distribution upgrade too\n\nReformat JSON dictionaries\nHelping to write unit tests\n\nIt’s difficult to quantify how much time GPT-4 has saved me, which it certainly has. I’d estimate it on average saves me about 1 hour of work per day. More than the time saved, the value of LLMs has been lowering the activation energy needed to get started. With data science and coding related prompts, I can arrive at answers much more directly and therefore quickly than trying to search Google and read StackOverflow answers. The code GPT-4 returns doesn’t always work the first time (zero-shot). In most cases, if an error is returned by that code, putting the error code back into the prompt will allow GPT-4 to generate correct code (one-shot, few-shot).\nAlong with Github Copilot, which is like autocomplete for code in an IDE like VS Code or PyCharm, I will likely never go back to coding without these assistants. They make me that much more productive. Though it’s also difficult to quantify how much more productive, 5%? 10%? 50%? There have been stories of people losing their jobs because of these technologies, but these are still relatively rare. I think the short-term impacts of these tools is making those that use them much more productive than those that don’t. Allen Downey wrote a post about LLM-assisted programming where he said:\n\nWhich brings me to what I think will be the most important skill for LLM-assisted programming: reading code. LLMs can generate code much faster than we can understand it, so the ability to read, understand, and check code will be critical.\n\n\nThe other skill that will become more important is meta-language, that is, the vocabulary we use to talk about programs. In my correlation in Elm example, I asked ChatGPT to “factor out the anonymous function”, and it new exactly what I meant. In general, it seems to understand the meta-language of programming well, so it will be useful if we can speak it.\n\nI tend to agree with his points. Reading code is going to be critical. Also knowing the right terminology or “meta-language” as Downey calls it to prompt the LLM is also critical. For example, using Github Copilot I was working in a Jupyter Notebook preparing some data for a model that was in a dataframe. I wrote a comment “# pivot this from wide to long” and the LLM was able to generate the code to do exactly what I needed. This took 5 seconds instead of 30-60 seconds to Google and arrive at this SO answer. But one would need to know what terms like “pivot” and what “wide” and “long” data are (see Hadley Wickham’s Tidy Data paper to learn more).\nTechnological advancements inevitably change jobs and work dynamics. Some jobs may disappear, while others may evolve, and new ones will emerge. Although it’s difficult to predict the pace and extent of these changes, there already have been a few studies on the topic. But I would take these with a grain of salt given how difficult it is to forecast the future.\n\n2023-03-02 - How will Language Modelers like ChatGPT Affect Occupations and Industries?\n2023-03-17 - GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models\n2023-04-23 - The Future of ChatGPT-enabled Labor Market: A Preliminary Study\n\nWhat is more valuable is waiting for real-world examples of how LLMs are affecting work. Here are some examples I’ve seen:\n\n2023-05-02 - IBM CEO Arvind Krishna says 30% of backoffice non-customer facing roles like human resources being replaced by AI. That’s 30% of 26,000 roles or 7,800 roles being replaced over the next 5 years. See this article for more details.\n2023-04-27 - In a letter to Dropbox employees, CEO Drew Houston said the company is laying off 16% of its workforce. He said the company is shifting its focus to early-stage product development and AI. See the full letter here. Two very interesting quotes where he talks about not being able to upskill his current workforce and needing to hire new talent:\n\n\nSecond, and more consequentially, the AI era of computing has finally arrived. We’ve believed for many years that AI will give us new superpowers and completely transform knowledge work. And we’ve been building towards this future for a long time, as this year’s product pipeline will demonstrate.\n\n\nIn an ideal world, we’d simply shift people from one team to another. And we’ve done that wherever possible. However, our next stage of growth requires a different mix of skill sets, particularly in AI and early-stage product development. We’ve been bringing in great talent in these areas over the last couple years and we’ll need even more.\n\nIt’ll be certainly interesting to see how these technologies continue to evolve and how they affect work."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been a fan of Costco for many years. Charlie Munger famously loved Costco too. I still remember growing up and going to Price Club with my mom or dad and seeing them write checks because they didn’t accept credit cards yet. There are many reasons to love Costco. It’s honestly one of my favorite places to shop. Some of my favorite things are in no particular order:\n\nGreat buyers who do an incredible job selecting products\nEmployees who seem to love their jobs and draw happy faces on receipts for kids\nFree samples\nGasoline that is typically 25-45 cents cheaper per gallon\n$5 Rotisserie Chicken\n$1.50 Hot dog + Soda\n$9.99 full size pizza\nGreat value on bulk items on goods like diapers, toilet paper, paper towels, etc.\nGenerous return policy - even for Apple products this goes up to 90 days\nCheapest place to get glasses and lenses\nMicrowavable bacon\nWhole Brisket (Prime/Choice that is typically around $4/lb)\nUp to 7.25% cash back on all spend: Using a BofA credit card + BofA Preferred Rewards status + as a Costco Executive Membership, you can earn 5.25% cash back using Costco Shop Cards. Details in this post. He also has his own post on how to shop at Costco like a boss.\nMilk that has absurdly long expired-by dates\nPhoto Prints - It used to be the cheapest place to get photo prints but they’ve since discontinued the business\n\nI recently learned about the Acquired podcast from Cal Newport’s post, How the Acquired Podcast Became a Sensation. They do long deep dives into business. One of their recent episodes was a 3-hour dive into all things Costco, the history of the company ad how it traces it’s roots into the people behind Fedmart and Price Club. After listening to the episode, I now appreciate Costco as a business even more. One of the biggest learnings was Costco capping their gross margins at 14%! This means they are intentionally leaving profits on the table to provide more value to their members! From the episode:\n\nAnd because of Costco’s gross margins always being targeted at 11% capped at 14%, this means that for every dollar that Costco gets a supplier to reduce the price on something—again, tough but fair—the customer actually sees most 89% of the benefit. Costco really does just get to pass whenever they get a benefit, 89% of that benefit goes to the member.\n\n\nThe way I look at this is some companies always look for ways to make more margin. Costco specifically does the opposite. They look for ways to provide more value to members, retain them for members as longer, and get them to get their friends to be members. They try hard across the board to get lower overhead costs through cleverness and efficiency, not through squeezing, underpaying, or anything like that.\n\nBased on the episode, here are 33 reasons why Costco is considered an extraordinary business:\n\nBulk Sales Model: “What if I told you that there was one place where you could get all these things under one roof? A 2½ pound container of cashews, prescription eyeglasses, a tank of gas, new tires for your car, 96 rolls of toilet paper, a new refrigerator, an outdoor shed, a 10 carat diamond ring, some freshly prepared sushi, fine wine at a great price.” - Ben illustrates the diverse and bulk offerings of Costco, underscoring the convenience and variety it provides to members.\nConsistent Low Prices: “And you could even grab a hot dog with a soda and a free refill on your way out for just $1.50. Hey, it has been the same price for 40 years now.” - Highlighting Costco’s commitment to maintaining low prices for its food court items, which enhances the shopping experience and customer loyalty.\nInnovative Operations: “But what really makes it work are the 50 clever innovations that they’ve refined over the years, that all work together like an orchestra that’s been rehearsing for decades.” - David acknowledges Costco’s operational ingenuity and continuous improvement mindset.\nQuality Products: “If your goal is to offer extremely great value to your customers on high-quality products at the lowest possible prices, there are a lot of ways that you could go about doing that.” - Ben emphasizes the company’s dedication to quality alongside its value proposition.\nCustomer Value Focus: “Today, we will walk through the very specific path of decisions and trade-offs that Costco has chosen to accomplish just this.” - Introducing the strategic decisions Costco makes to uphold its value proposition.\nRevenue Growth: “Costco has grown revenue right about 10% for over 30 years in a row.” - Showcasing Costco’s remarkable consistency in revenue growth.\nEfficient Space Utilization: “Their revenue per square foot of their warehouses belongs more in a conversation with Tiffany than Walmart.” - Highlighting how efficiently Costco utilizes its warehouse space to generate high revenue.\nKirkland Signature Brand: “Their store brand, Kirkland Signature, does more revenue alone, not including anything else in the store, than all of Nike.” - Demonstrating the success and scale of Costco’s private label brand.\nInternational Expansion Potential: “They seem to have incredible running room ahead of them to expand internationally and here in North America.” - Noting Costco’s significant potential for further global expansion.\nCustomer Loyalty: “Most of you are very familiar with this Disneyland of consumer value that I’m referring to.” - Ben alludes to the strong customer loyalty and fondness for Costco.\nSupply Chain Mastery: “Jim Sinegal, of course, co-founder and CEO of Costco, tells the story that a reporter once asked him if he learned a lot from Sol. Jim replied, no, that’s inaccurate. I didn’t learn a lot, I learned everything.” - Reflecting on the foundational knowledge and principles Costco inherited from its predecessors.\nLegal Compliance and Ethics: “Obey the law” - The primary code of ethics at Costco, ensuring that the company operates within legal boundaries and ethical standards.\nEmployee Care: “Take care of our employees” - Costco’s commitment to employee welfare, indicating the company’s recognition of its workforce as a key stakeholder.\nSupplier Respect: “Respect our suppliers” - Highlighting Costco’s ethical approach to dealing with suppliers, fostering mutual respect and long-term relationships.\nMembership Model Efficiency: “The economics of membership…selects for wealthy customers.” - Discussing how the membership model not only generates revenue but also curates a specific customer demographic.\nLow Shrinkage Rates: “Membership further decreases shrinkage.” - The impact of the membership model on reducing theft and loss within Costco warehouses.\nHigh-Quality Member Demographic: “The typical Costco consumer makes about $125,000 a year in household income.” - Indicating the affluent demographic of Costco’s membership base.\nStringent Product Markups: “Strict cap on the margin…only markup anything a maximum of 14% above what the suppliers sell it to them for.” - Explaining Costco’s policy on limiting product markups to ensure low prices for members.\nGlobal Expansion Success: “First, they go to the UK, then they go to Korea, to Taiwan, to Japan…” - Detailing Costco’s strategic and successful international expansion efforts.\nSustainable Growth Strategy: “Amazon is a company that works hard to charge its customers less, and that is directly from Jim Sinegal.” - Highlighting Costco’s influence on other major retailers regarding pricing strategy.\nMember Trust and Transparency: “Members have to trust that they are going to get the absolute best price on everything…” - The importance of maintaining member trust through transparent pricing and consistent value.\nEfficient Inventory Management: “Costco actually turns their inventory 12.4 times per year…” - Showcasing Costco’s exceptional efficiency in inventory management and the benefits of a negative cash conversion cycle.\nSelective Product Offering: “Each buyer is only really adding 3, 5, 10, maybe 15 new SKUs a year…” - Reflecting on the curated and limited product selection strategy that ensures quality and value.\nEthical Supplier Negotiations: “Costco buyers always ask why when a supplier tries to increase the price…” - Demonstrating Costco’s fair and informed approach to supplier negotiations.\nCommitment to Social Responsibility: “Sol and Robert are great at creative ideas in retail. They’re not so great at scale execution.” - Acknowledging the founders’ innovative contributions to retail, balanced with an awareness of their limitations in executing at scale, leading to strategic decisions that shaped Costco’s trajectory.\nLimited SKU Strategy: “Costco makes the opposite bet. They bet that you don’t need selection, as long as you ensure that everything you can buy is high quality…Consumers, because they do all that work ahead of time, are basically just okay, sacrificing selection entirely and saying, yeah, as long as you give us good value on great stuff, we’re totally okay with that.”\nTrust and Quality Over Selection: “That’s an important unlock. You can’t just have low selection and be like, well, it’s all cheap stuff. It has to be high quality in its category and the best deal on the market in order for people to be okay with low selection, which drives low SKU count, which drives all the amazing things we’ve talked about so far.”\nThe Intelligent Loss of Sales Principle: “Sol uses the example in the book of household lubricating oil, like WD-40 type stuff. He’s like, we only carried the eight ounce can, even though there was a three ounce can out there…But it was worth it to us to forgo that, because by only having the eight ounce can, we could reduce the number of SKUs that we had and get all these benefits that you’re talking about, Ben.”\nSimplifying Logistics Through Limited SKUs:: “They only have so many suppliers who are bringing goods to Costco. The fact that they sell in bulk means that they can bring a whole pallet into a warehouse and consumers just come and pluck it off the pallet…This is so much simpler, and it really plays into that cash flow dynamic, where things can be available for sale so fast.”\nEmployee Compensation and Efficiency: “This also plays into this labor thing. You can totally pay your employees more when you need less people to generate the same amount of sales. You don’t have wasted manpower unwrapping items from pallets, no one turning the labels out to look pretty. The customers do all of this. It legitimately means they just need less people.”\nThe Membership Model as a Profit Center: “A lot of people like to make a lot of hay about the idea that Costco generates all their profit on memberships and that retail is just a break-even business. This has been popular to say because they run the retail business at such thin margins. Memberships are nearly a 100% margin business.”\nHigh Renewal Rates and Customer Loyalty: “Executive members, as you would guess, also renew at a higher rate. It helps with retention…Ninety-three percent of members in the US renew every single year.”\nInnovative Crossdocking:\n\n\nExactly, but here’s how the distribution centers work. Trucks pull up on one side and unload pallets, that’s where the suppliers trucks are. On the other side of the warehouse, there are Costco trucks.\n\n\nWhat happens is, since they move stuff entirely by the pallet, no partial pallets, these few things go to this store, these few things go to that store, the supplier trucks unload the pallets. They just get scooted across the dock to go directly to a Costco warehouse. Within minutes to hours, that truck leaves, and there’s no unwrapping of individual boxes. There’s nothing sitting overnight in the facility.\n\n\nThis is so much simpler, and it really plays into that cash flow dynamic, where things can be available for sale so fast. Just to underscore how differentiated the system is, 92% of Costco’s merchandise is crossdocked. Only 10% of Walmart has crossdocked merchandise on a pallet system like this."

The name of the dog it extracts is correct in Milo but the breed it associates with Milo is incorrect, as it should be Border Collie.\n\ngpt-3-5-turbo does a better job of extracting all the relevant information and not hallucinating:\n[{'person_name': 'Alex', 'person_height': 5, 'person_hair_color': 'blonde'},\n {'person_name': 'Claudia',\n  'person_height': 6,\n  'person_hair_color': 'brunette'},\n {'dog_name': 'Willow',\n  'dog_breed': 'German Shepherd',\n  'dog_extra_info': 'likes to play with other dogs'},\n {'dog_name': 'Milo',\n  'dog_breed': 'border collie',\n  'dog_extra_info': 'lives close by'}]\nHopefully Google continues to iterate and improve upon Gemini Pro’s function calling capabilities. I imagine Gemini Ultra will do a better job out of the box as well."

    "text": "Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Language Modeling\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12561\nRecent multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-image and image-to-text generation. However, these models store all learned knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant text and images fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., documents on the web). Specifically, for the retriever, we use a pretrained CLIP, and for the generator, we train a CM3 Transformer on the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate both text and images. We show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MS-COCO), while requiring much less compute for training (&lt;30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show that RA-CM3 exhibits novel capabilities, such as faithful image generation and multimodal in-context learning (e.g., image generation from demonstrations).\n\nDevelop a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, a first of it’s kind\nThe generator uses retrieved items for generation too\nRetrieval augmented training - helped a lot"

By harnessing the power of these models, the proposed approach generates diverse utterances based on user goals and limited dialog examples. Unlike traditional simulators, this method eliminates the need for labor-intensive rule definition or extensive annotated data, making it more efficient and accessible. Additionally, an error analysis of the interaction between the user simulator and dialog system uncovers common mistakes, providing valuable insights into areas that require improvement. Our implementation is available at this https URL.\n\nRule based systems are still more accurate.

    "text": "Challenges in post-training quantization of Vision Transformers\nPaper: https://research.ibm.com/publications/challenges-in-post-training-quantization-of-vision-transformers\nVision Transformers recently showed outstanding performance in computer vision tasks. However, those models are compute and memory intensive that require accelerators with a large amount of memory like NVIDIA A100 graphic processing unit for training and even for inference. Post-training quantization is an appealing compression method, as it does not require retraining the models and labels to tune the model. In this paper, we look in depth at multiple models in terms of size, architecture, and training procedure and provide guidelines on how to quantize the model to an 8-bit integer, both weights and activations. We perform a well-rounded study on the effects of quantization and sensitivity to the quantization error. Moreover, we show that applying mixed-data precision quantization works well for most vision transformer models achieving up to 90% compression ratio within a 2% top-1 accuracy drop. This kind of quantization offers a trade-off between memory, compute, and performance of the models that are deployable with the current software and hardware stack.\n\nThere’s a difference between Static vs Dynamic Quantization\nLarger models are supposed to be easier to quantize, but not the case here\nSignal to noise quantization ratio - SNQR\nPartial Quantization: Some models that lost accuracy during dynamic quant, regained during 90% quant"

Motivated by their empirical performance, prior works have developed generalization bounds for graph neural networks, which scale with graph structures in terms of the maximum degree. In this paper, we present generalization bounds that instead scale with the largest singular value of the graph neural network’s feature diffusion matrix. These bounds are numerically much smaller than prior bounds for real-world graphs. We also construct a lower bound of the generalization gap that matches our upper bound asymptotically. To achieve these results, we analyze a unified model that includes prior works’ settings (i.e., convolutional and message-passing networks) and new settings (i.e., graph isomorphism networks). Our key idea is to measure the stability of graph neural networks against noise perturbations using Hessians. Empirically, we find that Hessian-based measurements correlate with observed generalization gaps of graph neural networks accurately; Optimizing noise stability properties for fine-tuning pretrained graph neural networks also improves the test performance on several graph-level classification tasks.\n\nOverfitting if there’s an imbalance between pretraining data and finetuning data size\nGeneralization gap\n\nNot just cross validation loss\nMore detailed understanding - what networks are causing the overfitting\nGeneralization gap - measures the gap between training/test losses"

However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna’s testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills. Even though WizardLM still lags behind ChatGPT in some aspects, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with AI-evolved instructions is a promising direction for enhancing LLMs. Our code and data are public at this https URL\nVerify and Edit CoT - Self-consistency\nKnowledge adapting framework\nLanguage diversity prompting\nStandard vs Personalized Distillation from LLMs"

While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable ability in achieving high-quality annotation in various tasks, the key to applying this ability to specific tasks lies in developing high-quality prompts. Thus we propose a framework to inherit the merits of both in-context learning and zero-shot learning by incorporating enriched instructions derived from input-output demonstrations to optimize original prompt. We refer to the enrichment as the Hint and propose a framework to automatically generate the hint from labeled data. More concretely, starting from an initial prompt, our method first instructs a LLM to deduce new hints for selected samples from incorrect predictions, and then summarizes from per-sample hints and adds the results back to the initial prompt to form a new, enriched instruction. The proposed method is evaluated on the BIG-Bench Instruction Induction dataset for both zero-shot and few-short prompts, where experiments demonstrate our method is able to significantly boost accuracy for multiple tasks"

There are actually 4 groups we should be concerned about:\n\nComplier: Individuals who would respond positively if treated and negatively if not treated.\nAlways-taker: Individuals who always respond positively no matter whether they are treated or not.\nNever-taker: Individuals who always respond negatively no matter whether they are treated or not.\nDefier: Individuals who would respond negatively if treated and positively if not treated.\n\nAlong with a benefit vector that assigns a positive or negative value to each of these 4 groups, we can use this to select the best treatment for each individual.\nAng also used the Pfizer Covid vaccine as a motivating example for why these 4 groups should be accounted for."

    "text": "Walter Isaacson is set to release a biography of Elon Musk later this year. He was recently on a Twitter Space with a few other people talking about Musk. One of the things that stood out to me was Isaacson’s description of Musk’s ability to focus. Here’s a transcript of what he said:\n\nBut I guess one of the most amazing things he does is he can sequentially focus. I remmeber the night he actually wound up getting Twitter, the board agreed, he was going to get Twitter, the deal was accepted. He went to Brownsville in order to do a Raptor engine redesign meeting late at night. And then stayed up with Kimbell in a honkeytonk. And then focused on the battery production issues and whether they all should be moved to Austin… it was all in one night.\n\nListening to this made me think about how important focus is. This idea also came up when I was speaking to another data scientist who asked me what is one thing that has helped you the most in your career. I told him focus. The ability to focus in our distracted age is becoming rarer and thus a more valuable skill if you can do it. Being able to focus means turning your attention to a single task (since multi-tasking is a myth). And your attention is focused on that task for an extended period of time. A big part of focus is being able to say no to certain things. This ability to focus has benefits not just in your career but also in your personal life.\nAs a data scientist, I might move from focusing on analyzing a new data set, writing deep learning training code, wrangling prompts for an LLM, reviewing someone else’s code in a pull request or writing long form documentation. All of these are distinct tasks that take a certain amount of focus. Being able to focus on these work tasks means saying no to interruptions that may come by way of Slack messages, emails, or even meetings. Some things that have helped me in this area:\n\nUsing a Pomodoro timer like Be Focused to work in 25 minute increments.\nFiguring out what hours of the day you do your best work. I find my energy takes a dip in the early afternoons and I try and do less cognitively intense tasks then.\nBlocking time on my calendar to do focused work. Even better, deciding ahead of time what you do in those time blocks.\nStacking meetings on a given day. I try to have all of my 1-1s on a single day.\n\nStepping out of my data scientist shoes, focus is incredibly valuable as a Christian: reading the Bible, praying, and memorizing verses all require focus. Being a father, focus is important too in order to be a present with your kids.\nDo your best to try and grow this muscle of focus. It will pay dividends in your career and personal life.\nCal Newport also has a great book on this topic called Deep Work. I highly recommend it."

    "text": "The WSJ’s Ben Cohen wrote an article highlighting Professor Po-Shen Loh, a math professor from Carnegie Mellon University and coach for Team USA’s International Mathematical Olympiad. He’s currently touring the country with a mission to inspire a love of mathematics and provide practical guidance for the new challenges brought by AI and tools like ChatGPT (giving 50 lectures in 32 cities in 35 days!). Loh’s message is clear: to survive in this era of artificial intelligence, one must lean into what makes us human.\nLoh emphasizes the importance of creativity, emotion, and human uniqueness, skills that AI cannot replicate, and which will become increasingly valuable as AI becomes more advanced. He wants young minds to understand the importance of their humanity in an AI-dominated future. However, this lesson is not just for students but applies to all businesses trying to navigate the uncharted territory of AI integration.\nThe new generation, Loh asserts, will have a better intuitive understanding of AI as they’re the first to grow up with this technology as a constant in their lives. With tools like ChatGPT being used in everyday life, young people are already interacting with and understanding the implications of AI. Being a millenial, though I do remember a time when there was no internet and needing to use a physical copy of Encylopedia Brittanica to do research, my generation grew up with Google and being able to access information at our fingertips. This next generation will grow up with AI and ChatGPT-like technologies as a constant in their lives.\nPo-Shen Loh’s message, while initially targeted towards students, has a universality that is applicable beyond the boundaries of classrooms; it serves as crucial advice for anyone preparing for the future of work in an AI-integrated world. Loh emphasizes the indispensable qualities of being able to create value and identify human pain points. In his words, “The future of jobs is figuring out how to find pain points, and a pain point is a human pain… You need to be able to create value. People who make value will always have opportunities.”\nI wholeheartedly concur with Loh’s perspective. In today’s rapidly advancing digital age, we can already see a distinct division emerging between those leveraging large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT effectively in their work, and those who do not. These tools can augment human capabilities, enable more efficient processes, and offer innovative solutions to complex problems.\nHowever, it is not the tools alone that will secure a competitive advantage. Instead, it is the ability to apply these tools ingeniously and to couple their computational prowess with human creativity, intuition, and understanding of complex human needs. This blend of technological aptitude and human sensitivity is what will differentiate the truly successful individuals and organizations in the future.\nLoh’s message should serve as a call to action for individuals and businesses alike: value creation, coupled with understanding and addressing human-centric concerns, is what will allow us to thrive in the AI-enhanced future. Those who can combine their unique human skills with the power of AI, to enhance their problem-solving capabilities and offer more value, will always find themselves at an advantageous position."

    "text": "Why I Started Running\nOn May 4th, I went for a 2 mile run. Little did I know that be the first run of many more runs over the next 5 months.\n\n\n\nFirst Run in May 2024\n\n\nAs noted in the image above, I was motivated to run after reading the book Outlive by Peter Attia. In his chapter on exercise, he talks about cardiovascular health and strength training as two key necessary things you need to do to stay healthy. That’s not anything I haven’t heard before. But what triggered something in me was this graph in the book. The metric plotted is VO2 max which measures how much oxygen your body can use during intense exercise.\n\n\n\nVO2 Max Declines with Age\n\n\nOne of the main arguments he makes in the book is if you want to do normal activities in your 60s, 70s, and 80s+, you need to train for that. Everyone’s VO2 max will decline over as they get older. However, the average person starts with a lower VO2 max than someone with above average fitness. And you need a certain amount of VO2 max (aka fitness) to do basic things like walk up hill, lift/carry heavy objects or run. I do want to do normal activities when God-willing my kids get older and I have grandchildren. I do want to be able to lift and carry my grandchildren and run after them. Imagining that future really did flip a switch in me where I became very motivated to take my health more seriously and so I went on that 2 mile run.\nI chose running as my exercise of choice because I found it to be the best-bang-for-your-buck form of exercise. I could go out for a couple mile run and be done in 20-30 minutes. A 20-30 bike ride didn’t really feel like much exercise. I didn’t enjoy swimming. I also had to give up basketball because of injuries. Praise God I could still run so I wanted to take advantage of that."

You can see how infrequently I ran in the proceeding months. There are some sparse weeks there!\n\n\n\nWeekly Miles - First Month\n\n\nIn late June, I decided to sign up for a 10k race because a friend told me about one. A couple friends and I signed up for it (thanks for running with me Andy & Shannon!). I thought running a race would be a good experience. And it was! There was a lot of adrenaline from the crowd and my kids even got to run the 1 mile “race” which they were excited about. I set a PR of 58:00 at this 10k (9:20 mins/mile).\nDuring this time, I knew some of my friends were already planning on doing the Long Beach Half-Marathon in October. When they were talking about a few months back, my thought was “No way.” But after running more consistently, I was on the fence in June. I said I was 50/50 in our group chat. The day after running the 10k, I went for it and signed up for the half.\n\n\n\nSigned Up!\n\n\nI started Nike Run Club’s 14 week half-marathon plan since the timing was perfect and I had heard good things about their Guided Runs. Well, fast forward 5 months and on Oct 6, I ran the Long Beach Half-Marathon in 1:49:15 (8:20 mins/mile). It was a joy doing this with some brothers and sisters from church and seeing a bunch of friends trying to get healthier and make fitness a regular part of their lives.\nPeople had recommended setting 3 goals: a bare minimum goal, a reachable goal and a stretch goal. So I did.\n\nBare Minimum Goal: Don’t get hurt\nReachable Goal: Finish the race\nStretch Goal: Sub 2 hours\n\nAfter training for something for 3+ months and meeting my stretch goal, it’s hard to explain how happy I was crossing this finish line.\n\n\n\nLong Beach Half-Marathon finish line\n\n\nSeeing my wife and kids at the finish line cheering me on was so awesome!\n\n\n\nLong Beach Half-Marathon finish\n\n\nI also downloaded some of the GPX data from Strava for some of my friends and I and animated it using GPX Animator."

    "text": "Things I’ve Learned about Running\n\nTypes of Runs\nEasy Running: Most runs should be “easy.” And by most, this is 80% of your total miles! Coming from basketball I was used to running fast, quick bursts. So when I would go for “runs” I would be going at a moderate to fast pace. I would quickly tire because my aerobic fitness was not very good and it just wouldn’t be pleasant. Reading a little about running and other endurance spots, you quickly learn a common recommendation “run easy” and “run at a conversational pace” and “run in Zone 2” to build your “aerobic base.” I didn’t fully understand what all of this meant yet but I just took their advice and started running easy. It did feel abnormally slow because I wasn’t used it. One of the main benefits is you can run for longer at this slower pace, it’s more enjoyable and it’s scientifically proven to train your mitochondria (I think?). Stephen Seiler has a TED talk where he explains the above idea in about 15 minutes. One of the slides shows the percentage of time spent in different training zones. You can see even for professional athletes, they spend 80% of their time in this “Low/Easy Intensity” area.\n\n\n\n% of training sessions\n\n\nThe other 20% of the running should be speed work. I used the Nike Run Club (NRC) app’s half-marathon training plan. Every week there were two recovery runs (1 15 minute run basically introducing the runs that week, another longer recovery run), two speed runs and 1 long run. The speed runs varied from intervals, tempo, to fartleks. I got to learn what all of these different runs were. The NRC app was particularly helpful for these runs because it guides you - when to start and stop a given interval and what type of effort to give at each interval (4-5 easy warmup, 6 for a 10k pace, 7-8 for a 5k pace, 8-9 for a mile pace and 10 for all out of ‘celebration’ pace).\nYou run out of energy at around 90 minutes. I remember one of my first long runs (Strava link) where I went past 60 minutes, I didn’t have any water or nutrition on me. It felt really terrible at around 80 minutes. I think my heart rate even peaked.\n\n\nGear\n\nShoes:\n\nFirst pair with Brooks Ghost. I got Ghost 15s but only Ghost 16s are available now. My friend sent me this comic that was pretty accurate why I picked them:\n\n\n\n\n\nBrooks Ghost Comic\n\n\n\nSecond pair was a Asics Novablast 4.\nI also started a 6 month membership to Road Runner Sports for $1.99. This allows you to buy shoes, run with them and return them if you do not like them. I wound up doing this a couple times for shoes that felt okay in store but for various reasons I didn’t like when going on an actual run. Not sure I’ll keep this membership after the trial though.\nShorts:\n\nNorthyard 5-inch shorts - Bought a few of the cheapest / well-reviewed shorts on Amazon.\nBALEAF Running Shirt - Similar search, bought a few.\n\nRunning Belt:\n\nSpibelt - Running belt to hold phone, keys.\n\nHydration Vest:\n\nSalomon ADV Skin 12 - For longer runs, this vest was very useful to carry water, gels, phone. I got a medium.\n\nNutrition:\n\nHuma Chia Energy Gels - For longer runs, I ate these. I haven’t tried other gels yet but I liked how these tasted and just stuck with them.\nBODYARMOR Flash IV Electrolyte - Also for longer runs. This is a 6 pack from Amazon ($1/pack) which is honestly a little egregious for salt. In theory you can make your own. I bought this 30 pack from Costco that was a little cheaper.\n\nGPS Watch: Apple Watch - I already had an Apple Watch so I just used it to track my runs using the native Fitness App.\n\nWhen starting an activity, there’s usually a count down, you can double tap to start it immediately\nWhen running, you can double tap the screen to start a new segment. This is useful when you are doing interval runs.\n\niOS Apps:\n\nFitness: Apple’s native fitness app. Can see detailed information on your workout. This gets really granular because GPS watches these days measure cadence, stride length and vertical oscillation.\nHealth: Seeing heart health data like Cardio Fitness (VO2 Max) and resting heart rate trend in better directions was so motivating!\nHealthFit: I used this to import all of my previous Apple Fitness data into Strava\nWorkOutDoors: More customizable fitness app. For example you can configure interval runs, total times for each interval, target paces for each interval and the app will warn you when you are outside of your target pace (too fast and too slow). This app makes your Apple Watch behave more like a Garmin.\nStrava: Fun and somewhat motivating to see how friends are staying active. Being a sucker for data, I enjoy seeing Strava’s global heatmaps by activity type and also the user created segments and receiving random rewards like “You set your best 2nd mile time!” Side note: I find it pretty amazing that Strava has built a business on monetizing fitness data that users are giving them.\n\n\nThese are the Strava weekly heatmaps. It’s cool thinking about all the people that went running and/or biking the last week to make this heatmap.\n\n\n\nHeatmap - Ride\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap - Run\n\n\n\n\nRacing\n\nRace strategy: Treat the first 75% of the race like a “warmup” for the last 25% of the race. Once you get to the last quarter, you can see how much you have left in the tank.\nIt’s must harder to go from the beginning of a training block to the starting line of a race than going from the starting line of a race to the finish line. So many things can go wrong over a 14-16 week training block, you can get sick, injured, or your kids can get sick. All kinds of things can come up."

I never thought I could even run this distance let alone do it and enjoy it and enjoy the whole training process. I grew up playing basketball which requires a totally different set of muscles. You need short bursts and fast twitch muscles. I still have yet to meet a basketball player who likes long distance running.\nThe human body has an amazing ability to be trained\nRunning regularly has given more time to think, pray and listen to audiobooks. It’s also given me more energy throughout the day.\nThe running community is generally positive. Nowadays it’s pretty easy to form groups around a share interest. I’ve found the running communities to be quite encouraging. It doesn’t matter what pace you are running."

    "section": "Things I’ve Learned about Christian Life",
    "text": "Things I’ve Learned about Christian Life\nThe Bible uses many running illustrations that have become more vivid as I’ve started running more consistently:\n\nDo you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified. (1 Corinthians 9:24-27)\nI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. (2 Timothy 4:7)\nTherefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. (Hebrews 12:1-2)\n\nFrom 1 Corinthians 9:24-27, we draw some parallels between physical running and spiritual running (basically Christian life):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nPhysical Running\nSpiritual Running\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nTo win a perishable prize (e.g., a medal, wreath)\nTo receive an imperishable prize (eternal life, spiritual reward, crown of glory, commendation from God)\n\n\nTraining\nRequires self-control and discipline in physical training\nRequires self-control and discipline in spiritual growth and character\n\n\nGoal\nTo finish the race and win, physical fitness and health\nTo live life of praise and glorifying God, aiming for eternal rewards\n\n\nFocus\nWinning the race, obtaining a temporary prize\nLiving with purpose, avoiding aimlessness, and striving for spiritual growth\n\n\nEffort\nDemands physical discipline and perseverance\nDemands spiritual discipline, avoiding complacency, and personal holiness\n\n\nMotivation\nEarthly recognition and achievement\nEternal recognition and spiritual fulfillment\n\n\nOutcome\nA perishable, temporary reward\nAn imperishable, everlasting reward\n\n\nConsequence of Failure\nLosing the race, disqualification\nSpiritual disqualification, falling short of spiritual goals\n\n\n\n\nDon’t compare yourself to others: I’ve also seen how easy it is to compare yourself to others in running and in Christian life. It’s easy to compare your pace or weekly mileage to others and say, “I wish I ran that fast.” But everyone is different. Everyone has had differing amounts of training up to that point. Everyone’s body is different. People have different goals. I’ve found it’s better to just be inspired by what others are able to do. Then if you want to compare, compare with your previous self. How long was I able to run at a conversational pace 1 month ago? 3 months ago? In Christian life it’s also easy to compare how fast/well one is running and compare yourself to others. But similarly, everyone is on a different spiritual journey with differing spiritual backgrounds. If you want to compare, compare with your previous self. How much have I grown in things like the fruit of the Spirit since I became a Christian? How much have I grown in love of God and people?\nSelf-control is so important: 1 Cor 9:25 says, “Every athlete exercises self-control in all things.” Athletes exercise self-control because it’s necessary to have good performance. Even in building a simple habit of running for 30 minutes a day, this requires self-control and discipline to find the time to do so, sleeping early to wake up early to do this (if you want to do it in the morning before your kids wake up), committing to a running plan, actually running the runs on those plans, etc. In Christian life, growing in self-control over my desires means I can better fight temptation and sinful desires and ultimately be a better instrument for noble purposes, useful to God for any good work (2 Tim 2:21).\nDon’t run aimlessly: It’s been helpful to have goals while running. Following the NRC running plan was helpful. Knowing what runs I was going to do on each day was helpful. Knowing the purpose of each run and what it was doing to my body was motivating as well. There were times I didn’t have a good idea of how far I was going to run that day. Sometimes on those days I wound up cutting my runs short because of the lack of motivation. In Christian life, it’s important to have spiritual direction. Where is God leading you? And if you have a family and especially if you are a husband, how and where are you leading your family?\nDisciplining the body: Running has helped me discipline my body. Starting off the day with something physically demanding helps set the tone for the rest of the day. Another example is running provides an outlet for me to think and pray. This helps to get my mind settled for the day ahead as well.\n\n1 Tim 4:8 says, “for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.” The Bible says bodily training is of some value! This should provide some motivation to a Christian to take exercise seriously. However the passage goes onto say that godliness is more important because it holds promise for this life and the life to come. I take this to mean our spiritual fitness and our relationship with Christ is more important to God than our physical fitness. There were times on this running journey I took running too seriously and prioritized it above the things God wanted me to prioritize like my family. So one big takeaway has been to not allow good things (like running) to supercede the best things (honoring and glorifying God)."

It’s turned into a habit now that I really enjoy where I try to run 20-30 miles a week.\n\n\n\nLast 6 months of running\n\n\nAlong the way I’ve learned so much about running, myself and even Christian life.

    "text": "There’s seemingly a firehose of development in the last month or so. I’ve been trying to keep up with the latest developments in GPT and related models. Here’s a list of papers, code, and news that I’ve found interesting. This is mainly for myself to have a reference, but I hope it’s useful to others as well. I was largely inspired by @osanseviero who created ml_timeline.\n\nPapers\n\n2022-08-21 - Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models (paper, blog)\n2023-03-13 - Alpaca – Stanford’s CRFM group released a 1.5B parameter GPT-3 like model. They were the first to demonstrate you can get GPT-like performance using only 52k instruction-following data points. On the self-instruct evaluation set, Alpaca shows many behaviors similar to OpenAI’s text-davinci-003, but is also surprisingly small and easy/cheap to reproduce. I think one reason OpenAI dropped their pricing by 90% with GPT-4 is because they wanted to achieve wide distribution of their model.\n2023-03-15 - GPT-4 Technical Paper (paper) - highlights some of the amazing improvements GPT-4 has made over GPT-3\n2023-03-27 - GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models (paper) – Paper that identifies the occupations that have the highest exposure to automation by GPT. In related news, ResumeBuilder found 1 in 4 companies have already replaced workers with ChatGPT\n2023-03-22 - Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence (paper)\n2023-03-20 – Reflexion: an autonomous agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection (paper). A related post.\n2023-03-23 - AI Explained – GPT4 can improve itself (video) - Intro to Reflexion and HuggingGPT\n2023-03-30 - HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace (paper, code) - Using a LLM as brain, HuggingGPT identifies what HuggingFace models to use to solve tasks. Notably Microsoft is calling this JARVIS.\n\n\n\nLibraries / Tools\n\nGithub Copilot - I use Copilot in my IDE, VS Code and it’s dramatically improved my producitivity (10-20%?). More than that it makes coding less tedious and lowers the activiation energy for coding tasks. For example generating docstrings is trivial (and happens much more frequently!). And because the recommendations are inline, the developer’s ‘flow’ is not broken. I also moved from Jupyter Notebooks in a browser to using Jupyter in VS Code. Radek Omulski has a blog post for how to set this up. I do plan to try GenAI as well. I tried GenAI and it basically automatically sends all errors to ChatGPT and provides suggested corrected syntax to try in line in your Jupyter notebook. It actually can be a nice complement to Copilot.\nLangChain - Building applications with LLMs through composability\nllama_index - LlamaIndex (GPT Index) is a project that provides a central interface to connect your LLM’s with external data.\nGenAI - generative AI tooling for IPython\nmarvin - Meet Marvin: a batteries-included library for building AI-powered software. Marvin’s job is to integrate AI directly into your codebase by making it look and feel like any other function.\n\n\n\nPrompt Engineering\nPrompt engineering is the process of creating prompts for LLMs. Essentially optimizing the input into LLMs.\n\nWhat is Prompt Engineering - like how Googling became a skill (aka “Google-fu”), I think Prompt Engineering is an important skill to develop\nawesome-chatgpt-prompts - A curated list of awesome ChatGPT prompts. I like “Act as a Linux Terminal” prompt.\nPrompt Engineering Guide - “Motivated by the high interest in developing with LLMs, we have created this new prompt engineering guide that contains all the latest papers, learning guides, lectures, references, and tools related to prompt engineering.” Code: repo.\n\n\n\nOutput Parsers\nWhere prompt engineering works on the input to LLMs, output parsers work on the output.\n\nOutput Parsers - LangChain calls this “Output Parsers”. LangChain can return a list, JSON, any Python type (using Pydantic) and two other ways of handling outputs: OutputFixingParser and RetryOutputParser\nEnforcing AI Format - Marvin calls this “Enforcing AI format”. Marvin can return a string, list of dicts, JSON or really any Python type (using Pydantic)\n\n\n\nPredictions\n\n2023-04-01 - @AllenDowney predicts “The great majority of coding will be LLM-assisted, starting now.” (tweet, blog)"

And cheaper!\nFine-tuning is becoming cheaper.\nEvaluation of LLMs is very hard - feels very subjective still.\nManaged APIs are expensive.\n“Traditional” ML isn’t going anywhere.\nMemory matters - for both serving and training.\nInformation retrieval w/ vector databases is becoming standard pattern.\nStart w/ prompt engineering and push that to its limits before fine-tuning w/ smaller models.\nUse agents/chains only when necessary. They are unruly.\nLatency is critical for a good user experience.\nPrivacy is critical.\n\nAs a practicing data scientist, #6 is reassuring!\nHere are some of the videos:\n\nMatei - LLMOps: The Emerging Toolkit for Reliable, High-quality LLM Applications\nChip - Building LLM Applications for Production\nSamyam - Do More with Less: Large Model Training and Inference with DeepSpeed"

It was somewhat surprising being one of the few data scientists at the conference as most people I met were software engineers trying to transition into AI Engineering.\nThe talks were livestreamed (Day 1 and Day 2).

Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as \"maison -&gt; house, chat -&gt; cat, chien -&gt;\", an approach called few-shot learning.When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\".

Prompt engineering is enabled by in-context learning, defined as a model's ability to temporarily learn from prompts. The ability for in-context learning is an emergent ability of large language models.\n# A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform. A prompt for a text-to-text model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat's little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem about leaves falling\", a short statement of feedback (for example, \"too verbose\", \"too formal\", \"rephrase again\", \"omit this word\") or a longer statement including context, instructions, and input data. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". Prompt engineering may consist of a single prompt that includes a few examples for a model to learn from, such as \"maison -&gt; house, chat -&gt; cat, chien -&gt;\", an approach called few-shot learning.When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\".

A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.A prompt for a text-to-text model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat\\'s little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem about leaves falling\", a short statement of feedback (for example, \"too verbose\", \"too formal\", \"rephrase again\", \"omit this word\") or a longer statement including context, instructions, and input data. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as \"maison -&gt; house, chat -&gt; cat, chien -&gt;\", an approach called few-shot learning.When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\". Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.\\n\\nPage: Sentence embedding\\nSummary: In natural language processing, a sentence embedding refers to a numeric representation of a sentence in the form of a vector of real numbers which encodes meaningful semantic information.State of the art embeddings are based on the learned hidden layer representation of dedicated sentence transformer models. BERT pioneered an approach involving the use of a dedicated [CLS] token preprended to the beginning of each sentence inputted into the model; the final hidden state vector of this token encodes information about the sentence and can be fine-tuned for use in sentence classification tasks. In practice however, BERT\\'s sentence embedding with the [CLS] token achieves poor performance, often worse than simply averaging non-contextual word embeddings.

Prompt engineering is enabled by in-context learning, defined as a model's ability to temporarily learn from prompts. The ability for in-context learning is an emergent ability of large language models.\n# A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.

Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\".

    "section": "Concept and its Benefits",
    "text": "Concept and its Benefits\n\nConcept\nProblem: Suppose you’re interested in estimating the causal effect of a treatment variable ( T ) on an outcome ( Y ), while controlling for a high-dimensional set of covariates ( X ). The relationship could be something like ( Y = + T + g(X) + ), where ( g(X) ) is a potentially complex and high-dimensional function, and ( ) is an error term.\nHigh-Dimensionality Issue: Directly estimating ( ) is challenging because of the high dimensionality of ( g(X) ). Traditional methods might suffer from overfitting or might not capture the nuanced relationship of ( X ) with ( Y ).\nSolution via DML: DML breaks down the problem into two stages:\n\nFirst Stage: Use machine learning methods to predict ( Y ) and ( T ) based on ( X ). Obtain the residuals from these predictions.\nSecond Stage: Regress the residuals of ( Y ) on the residuals of ( T ) to estimate ( ). This step isolates the effect of ( T ) on ( Y ), controlling for ( X ), without directly modeling ( g(X) ).\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\nFlexibility: DML doesn’t make strong assumptions about the functional forms of relationships, allowing for the use of flexible ML techniques.\nRobustness: By working with residuals, DML reduces concerns about model misspecification. Even if the first-stage models aren’t perfect, as long as they’re reasonably good, the second-stage estimate of ( ) can still be consistent and accurate.\nHigh-Dimensional Controls: DML is particularly suited for cases with many control variables. This is common in modern datasets where one might have a vast number of potential confounders.\nInterpretability: The final result, ( ), provides a clear and interpretable estimate of the causal effect of ( T ) on ( Y ).\n\n\n\nExample\nImagine you want to estimate the effect of a training program (treatment ( T )) on employee performance (outcome ( Y )), controlling for a range of employee attributes ( X ) (like age, experience, past performance metrics, personality scores, and so on). Using DML, you would first predict performance and program participation based on all these controls using ML models. Then, you’d isolate the unexplained variations (residuals) of performance and program participation and estimate the effect of the training program using these residuals."

But, with high-dimensional controls, this approach faces issues like overfitting or multicollinearity.\n\n\nInstrumental Variables (IV)\nIV methods are used when the treatment variable is endogenous (correlated with the error term). IV requires the identification and use of an instrument that affects the treatment but has no direct effect on the outcome. Finding such instruments can be challenging.\n\n\nDifference-in-Differences (DiD)\nDiD estimates causal effects by looking at changes in outcomes over time between a group that receives the treatment and a group that doesn’t. This method assumes that the two groups would have followed parallel trends in the absence of treatment, an assumption that’s sometimes hard to validate.\n\n\nMatching and Propensity Score Methods\nThese involve pairing treated and untreated subjects that have similar observable characteristics. It’s often difficult to balance all covariates, especially in high dimensions, and unobserved confounding remains a challenge."

DML can handle high-dimensional controls efficiently by leveraging machine learning techniques.\n\n\nRobustness to Model Misspecification\nDML’s two-stage process (predicting using ML and then regressing the residuals) ensures that even if the first-stage predictions aren’t perfect, the causal estimate can still be consistent and accurate.\n\n\nLeverages Machine Learning\nBy integrating machine learning into causal inference, DML can use complex, non-linear models to control for confounding, something that’s challenging with traditional linear methods.\n\n\nNo Need for Strong Instruments or Parallel Trends\nUnlike IV or DiD, DML doesn’t rely on finding strong instruments or making assumptions about parallel trends, making it applicable in a broader range of scenarios.\n\n\nInteroperability with Other Techniques\nDML can be combined with other methods like instrumental variables (e.g., in the form of Double/Debiased Machine Learning with Instruments) to tackle more complex causal questions.\nIn essence, while traditional econometric methods have their value and are optimal in certain settings, DML provides a flexible and robust framework for causal inference in modern datasets with many covariates. It bridges the gap between the strengths of classical econometric methods and the power of machine learning."

By integrating DML techniques, HR departments can make more informed decisions based on robust causal inferences."

    "text": "Here’s why you might choose different models:\n\nDifferent Natures of Relationships\nThe relationship between the confounders and the treatment might be different from the relationship between the confounders and the outcome. For instance, a non-linear model like a decision tree or random forest might capture the relationship between the confounders and the treatment best, while a linear model might be most appropriate for the relationship between the confounders and the outcome.\n\n\nModel Performance Considerations\nIn some settings, certain machine learning models might perform better (in terms of predictive accuracy) for the treatment assignment, while others might be better suited for modeling the outcome.\n\n\nComputational Considerations\nIn some scenarios, especially with large datasets, computational efficiency might dictate the choice of models. Training a complex model might be computationally prohibitive for one task but feasible for another, depending on the data’s dimensionality and the relationships present.\nWhile DML allows for such flexibility, it’s important to remember the foundational assumption: both models (for ( T ) and ( Y )) should be sufficiently rich to capture the true relationships in the data. If the models are misspecified or too simplistic, it can introduce bias in the estimated treatment effects.\nIn practice, using cross-validation or other model selection techniques can help determine which models are best suited for each step in the DML process."

This is because the ML models for treatment and outcome might fit the noise in the data, leading to biased nuisance estimates and, subsequently, biased treatment effect estimates.\nCross-Fitting is Preferred: Cross-fitting is typically preferred in DML because it helps ensure that the estimated causal effects are not driven by overfitting to the idiosyncrasies in the data. It also provides a more robust estimate of the treatment effect across different subsets of the data.\nFinal Model Assessment: After obtaining the causal effect estimates using DML, it’s a good practice to assess the performance of the final model on a completely separate validation set, if available. This ensures that the DML procedure generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nTo summarize, handling data splits in DML is integral to its methodology. Properly performed, it ensures that the estimated causal effects are both valid and generalizable."

It is a multi-task, multilingual model that can perform speech recognition, speech translation and language identification. It was released in September 2022 and achieved state of the art results. The latest model is whisper-large-v3 which OpenAI released on their Dev Day.\nI had heard about Whisper when it was released but got interested in using Whisper after Georgi Gerganov of llama.cpp fame created an equivalent library called whisper.cpp. He ported Whisper to C/C++ and also added accelerated inference on Apple Metal. This means that llama.cpp and whisper.cpp both allow you to run these transformer based models locally using a CPU or if you have a M1/M2/M3 Mac, to run these models at a reasonable speed."

    "title": "All-In Hosts Opinion on Jobs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "During Episode 132 of the All-In Podcast, (transcript here) the hosts took a live question from the audience:\n\n\nHi, I’m Jeff, a full-time corporate VC and part-time angel. My question is about AI and higher education and it’s actually some covert parenting advice so you can decide who’s that’s relevant for. My son just finished his freshman year of college and I’m questioning what the future is for him in higher education, given all the change that AI is going to have on every career and every profession. And I’m wondering what advice you’d give to your child or someone who’s in college right now for what’s an area of study that maybe won’t be disrupted by AI or an area that AI, you’ll get leverage from your education through AI.\n\nChamath:\n\nI think the reality is that most of the existing jobs that we have in the United States are going to go to lower cost locations that have that tool chain to accelerate their capability. So we are going to have to reinvent the workforce and the things that we do over the next 30 or 40 years to stay relevant. That’s probably like, I think that should just be the operating principle. If you think about it, we used to run great call centers. Okay, those call centers were outsourced to the Philippines and India. But in the next, you know, five or 10 years, you’ll have this flawless unaccented English or even more eerily, perfectly accented English for the zip code of the person that’s calling in so that it sounds like they’re talking to somebody that’s literally their neighbor. That’s like just makes so much sense, right? So it’s like all this stuff is going to happen where like all these classes of jobs are going to go away. I saw this article where a lawyer, two lawyers use chat GPT to submit a legal brief. The problem was that it cited cases that didn’t exist and now they’re going to be disbarred. So this is like serious business, right? Like you can’t do that.\n\n\nYou know, if I had to choose something for my kids, I would probably, I would probably tell them to do something mathematical or biological.\n\nJason:\n\nI’ve been thinking about this a lot too. I think teaching them to be entrepreneurial, resilient, worldly, ability to communicate, ability to lead other people in teams, that stuff’s not going to go away, communication skill, etc. I’m encouraging everybody who I work with to just use chat GPT-4 and Bard every day for every single thing that they do. My base thesis right now is that the job freezes, the hiring freezes out of all these companies is indefinite. I’m assuming it’s indefinite because the amount of work it takes to write a job requisition is more work in some cases than actually automating with AI or ready the job function. And so I think 20 person companies might double in size in the next two or three years, but still have 20 people. This is going to be a big challenge for society. And if that does come to pass, there’s just going to be large swaths of people who are not going to be able to get job interviews for anything other than service jobs. We need a lot more plumbers, electricians, waiters, et cetera. Those probably jobs won’t go away, especially if we don’t let people immigrate. I am super enthusiastic about that efficiency, but I think it also means you have to be entrepreneurial because if you can’t get a job and you can’t get mentored, you better create your own opportunity. You better create your own company. And that’s what I’m seeing. That’s the game on the field right now. Two or three people who don’t have job offers from Uber and Airbnb and Google and Facebook just saying, let’s start a company because there’s nothing else for us to do. And those are highly skilled people right now doing that.\n\nSacks:\n\nI’ll say two quick things about this topic. So one is, I think there’s a lot of AI fear porn out there right now. And I just think that like all of these tumor scenarios are, they’re not going to play out overnight. I mean, this is going to take a while. Second, if you think about like job elimination, it’s going to be some super specialized jobs. So for example, I wouldn’t want to be a radiologist right now, but doctors will be fine. So I think if you’re thinking about like going into a job category that’s super specialized and clearly in the way of AI, then that probably is not a good idea. But most general skills like you’re talking about and most job categories are going to be fine. There’s just going to be some specialties within them that make it. dislocated. Like, I wouldn’t want to be a truck driver either, you know, because of self-driving. But transportation companies are still going to exist. So I think you just want to be careful about super specialization, I think. But building general skills is always really good. That really should be the point of college.\n\nMy observations:\n\nI found it surprising Sacks thought lawyers and accountants were “sufficiently” general that he doesn’t think they’ll be eliminated.\nSacks’ point that some super specialized jobs will be eliminated is a good one, e.g. radiologists. But I also think some lawyers and accounting jobs will go this route too.\nJason is telling his employees to use GPT-4 or Bard for every task at work. I agree this is a good idea to get familiar with how LLMs work and to essentially have a super-assistant at your disposal. GPT-4 is particularly good.\nOverall I think it’s still too early to make any definitive statements about what jobs will be eliminated. I think it’s safe to say that most jobs will be affected in some way, but it’s hard to say how. This is something I’m fascinated by though, how as a society we will adjust as these language models permeate through organizations, companies and products."

    "text": "How will LLMs affect the future of work?\nI had the idea of using an LLM to assess the impact of LLMs on jobs. Having got llama2 up and running on my Mac M1 Pro using llama.cpp, it was pretty easy to use langchain, a set of occupations from ONET, and the llama2-13b-chat model to generate 10 ways that LLMs will affect a given occupation for the 1,016 ONET occupations. This took about 50 seconds per title to run and in total around 14 hours (and an unknown amount of electricity).\nThe idea and the prompt I used was partially inspired by the paper GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models where the framework they used to evaluate the impact of LLMs on jobs used LLMs to do the evaluation and their measure of a given job’s exposure used:\n\nDirect exposure (E1) if using the described LLM via ChatGPT or the OpenAI playground can decrease the time required to complete the DWA or task by at least half (50%).\nLLM+ Exposed (E2) if access to the described LLM alone would not reduce the time required to complete the activity/task by at least half, but additional software could be developed on top of the LLM that could reduce the time it takes to complete the specific activity/task with quality by at least half. Among these systems, we count access to image generation systems.\n\nSo the prompt I used was:\n\"As an {TITLE}, what are 10 areas of your work that you think will get disrupted by the widespread usage of LLMs or tools built on LLMs?\""

Data Preprocessing: Many tasks in data preprocessing, such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, can be automated using LLMs. This could make my work more efficient and reduce the time spent on these tasks.\n# 2. Feature Engineering: LLMs can help generate new features that can improve model performance. For example, LLMs can be used to generate sentiment scores or topic models for text data. This could lead to better insights and improved accuracy in machine learning models.\n# 3. Data Visualization: LLMs can be used to generate interactive visualizations that provide more detailed insights into data. For example, LLMs can be used to create interactive heatmaps or word clouds that show the distribution of words in a dataset.\n# 4. Text Summarization: LLMs can be used to summarize long documents or articles into shorter summaries. This could be useful for quickly grasping the main points of a document or article.\n# 5. Sentiment Analysis: LLMs can be used to analyze text data and provide sentiment scores. This could be useful for understanding public opinion on a particular topic or product.\n# 6. Named Entity Recognition (NER): LLMs can be used to automatically identify and extract named entities such as people, organizations, and locations from text data. This could save time and improve the accuracy of downstream tasks such as information extraction or summarization.\n# 7. Part-of-speech Tagging: LLMs can be used to automatically assign part-of-speech tags to words in a sentence. This could improve the accuracy of downstream tasks such as named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.\n# 8. Dependency Parsing: LLMs can be used to analyze the grammatical structure of sentences and identify the relationships between words. This could lead to better insights into language usage and improved accuracy in natural language processing tasks.\n# 9. Information Extraction: LLMs can be used to automatically extract structured data from unstructured text. For example, LLMs can be used to extract names, dates, and locations from news articles or social media posts.\n# 10. Question Answering: LLMs can be used to answer questions based on the content of a document or article. This could be useful for providing quick answers to common customer support queries or for automating content search engines.\n# Overall, the widespread adoption of LLMs and tools built on LLMs has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of many tasks in data science, particularly those involving natural language processing.\n\nRepeating this for a Pediatric Pharmacist:\n\nprompt=\"\"\"\nAs an entry-level Pediatric Pharmacist, what are 10 areas of your work that you think will get disrupted by the widespread usage of LLMs or tools built on LLMs?\n\"\"\"\nllm(prompt)\n# Although I am an early career pharmacist, and I lack industry expertise as a seasoned professional in the field of pediatrics or AI technology I can imagine several ways that LLMs could disrupt various aspects of my work:\n# 1. Medication dosing: One potential area of disruption is medication dosing. LLMs may be able to quickly and accurately determine appropriate drug dosages for children based on their weight, age, and other factors, potentially reducing the need for human intervention and improving medication safety. \n# 2.Drug interactions: Another possible area of disruption is the identification of potential drug interactions. LLMs may be able to analyze large amounts of data and identify potential drug interaction that a human pharmacist might miss, helping to prevent adverse events and improve patient outcomes. \n# 3. Allergic reactions: With their ability to analyze large amounts of data, LLMs may also be useful in identifying patterns related to allergic reactions, allowing healthcare providers to take proactive steps to prevent these reactions or quickly respond to them if they occur.\n# 4. Developmental delays: The use of LLMs could help identify children at risk for developmental delays and provide early interventions that can improve outcomes for those children.\n# 5. Pediatric clinical decision support: With the ability to process vast amounts of data, LLMs may be able provide real-time clinical decision support to healthcare providers, improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing errors in patient care.  \n# 6. Medical coding and billing: The use of LLMs could improve the accuracy of medical coding and billing, potentially reducing errors and improving reimbursement for healthcare providers. \n# 7. Pharmacovigilance: With their ability to analyze large amounts of data, LLMs may also be useful in pharmacovigilance by identifying potential safety issues related to pediatric medication use and allowing healthcare providers to take proactive steps to mitigate these risks.\n# 8 Patient education: The use of LLMs could improve patient education, allowing healthcare providers to provide tailored information that addresses the unique needs of each child based on their medical history, allergies, and other factors. \n# 9. Referrals and consultations: With the ability to diagnose and treat a wide range of pediatric conditions, LLMs could help identify children who require specialist care or consultation with other healthcare providers, potentially reducing unnecessary referrals and improving patient outcomes.  \n# 10. Public health surveillance: Finally, the use of LLMs could improve public health surveillance by analyzing large amounts of data related to pediatric health issues, allowing healthcare providers to identify trends and patterns that can inform population-based interventions and policies. \n# As an early career pharmacist, I recognize that the widespread adoption of LLMs or tools built on these technologies will require significant investment in training and infrastructure, as well as careful consideration of ethical and legal issues related to health data privacy and security.  \n# However, if properly implemented, these technologies have the potential to transform the field of pediatric pharmacology, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs over time. Despite the challenges ahead, I remain excited about the potential applications of LLMs in pediatric pharmacology practice and look forward to seeing how these developments shape the future of our profession."

I think it would benefit most people to think about how a general purpose technology like LLMs (Andrew Ng calls AI like electricity in their broad applicability) will affect the specific things they are working and how they can use this technology to make themselves more productive. A similar analogy is those who have gotten good at searching with Google are that much more productive than those who haven’t. LLMs are a much more powerful tool than a search engine (after all you can give an LLM a search tool) and it’s important more people understand how to use this new tool."

It is not available as an API, rather only through the ChatGPT web interface for ChatGPT Plus subscribers ($20/month).\nIf you aren’t familiar with Code Interpreter, it is:\nReally the only change is a “+” button in the ChatGPT interface but this small change unlocks quite a bit of use cases. One of which is data analysis since you can upload data and have the LLM analyze and reason over it.\nOverall I am quite impressed with Code Interpreter’s capabilities. I would characterize Code Interpreter as a very capable intern whose output you need to validate. That being said it is a very capable agent in doing data analysis tasks. I would estimate this analyses took me 20 minutes to do. If I actually wanted to do it, I’d estimate it would’ve taken me 2 hours, so 6x longer. But it’s not just a matter of time savings, it is a matter of cognitive-load savings. It was not very cognitively-intense to use Code Interpreter whereas I, a human, doing these analyses would’ve taken me a lot of mental energy. Because of that, I’d held off on running this type of analyses for a long time (sitting on this idea for a year?) but with Code Interpreter, I was able to do it in 20 minutes. And this opens up many other analyses that I would love to do but have not had the time or energy to do."

    "text": "Two Reward Models\nInterestingly they also try to generate a diversity of model completions by using two different model variants and different temperature hyperparameters.\n\nOur annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose between two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the two responses to a given prompt are sampled from two different model variants, and varying the temperature hyper-parameter. In addition to giving participants a forced choice, we also ask annotators to label the degree to which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice is significantly better, better, slightly better, or negligibly better/ unsure.\n\nThis model is a first for training two separate reward models, one for safety and one for helpfulness. Meta collected over 1.4M binary comparisons to train their safety and helpfulness reward models. The human annotators also had to pick between 5 different options: significantly better, better, slightly better, or negligibly better/ unsure.\nThe training data for the RLHF models is actually their newly collected preference data along with open source datasets. They do not observe “negative transfer” happening from using open source data so they decided to keep it in to allow for better generalization. The RHLF models are only trained for one epoch to prevent overfitting.\n\nWe combine our newly collected data with existing open-source preference datasets to form a larger training dataset. Initially, open-source datasets were used to bootstrap our reward models while we were in the process of collecting preference annotation data. We note that in the context of RLHF in this study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference for Llama 2-Chat outputs rather than any model outputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source preference datasets. Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better generalization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e. Llama 2-Chat taking advantage of some weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.\n\n\nHelpfulness reward model is eventually trained on all Meta Helpfulness data, combined with an equal parts of the remaining data uniformly sampled from Meta Safety and from the open-source datasets.\nSafety reward model is trained on all Meta Safety and Anthropic Harmless data, mixed with Meta Helpfulness and open-source helpfulness data in a 90/10 proportion. We found that the setting with 10% helpfulness data is especially beneficial for the accuracy on samples where both the chosen and rejected responses were deemed safe."

The same re-ranking strategy for LLMs was also proposed in Deng et al. (2019), where the reward is seen as an energy function. Here, we go one step further, and use the selected outputs for a gradient update. For each prompt, the sample obtaining the highest reward score is considered the new gold standard. Similar to Scialom et al. (2020a), we then fine-tune our model on the new set of ranked samples, reinforcing the reward.\n\nThe two RL algorithms differ in:\n\nBreadth — in Rejection Sampling, the model explores K samples for a given prompt, while only one generation is done for PPO. Depth — in PPO, during training at step t the sample is a function of the updated model policy from t − 1 after the gradient update of the previous step. In Rejection Sampling fine-tuning, we sample all the outputs given the initial policy of our model to collect a new dataset, before applying the fine-tuning similar to SFT. However, since we applied iterative model updates, the fundamental differences between the two RL algorithms are less pronounced.\n\n\n\n\nMax Reward among N Samples\n\n\nThe above plot is interesting in that it highlights the potential gain from using Rejection Sampling. Because more samples are generated, a diversity of completions can be explored and on average these generates a higher maximum reward.

The dataset also contains a few synthetic constraints to sample from like hobbies, language or public figure (and random combinations of the above).

High IRR scores (closer to 1.0) are typically seen as better from a data quality perspective, however, context is important. Highly subjective tasks like evaluating the overall helpfulness of LLM generations will usually have lower IRR scores than more objective labelling tasks. There are relatively few public benchmarks for these contexts, so we feel sharing our analysis here will benefit the research community. We used Gwet’s AC1/2 statistic (Gwet, 2008, 2014) to measure inter-rater reliability (IRR), as we found it to be the most stable metric across different measurement scenarios. On the 7-point Likert scale helpfulness task that is used in our analysis, Gwet’s AC2 score varies between 0.37 and 0.55 depending on the specific model comparison. We see scores on the lower end of that range for ratings from model comparisons with similar win rates to each other (like the Llama 2-Chat-70B-chat vs. ChatGPT comparison).

For example, our prompt set does not include any coding- or reasoning-related prompts. We only evaluate the final generation of a multi-turn conversation. A more interesting evaluation could be to ask the models to complete a task and rate the overall experience with the model over multiple turns. Human evaluation for generative models is inherently subjective and noisy. As a result, evaluation on a different set of prompts or with different instructions could result in different results."

    "section": "RHLF > SFT",
    "text": "RHLF &gt; SFT\nThe authors make a fascinating conclusion of the superiority of RHLF to supervised-finetuning because of the limitations of human authors to generate diverse and high-quality text.\n\nEven with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on SFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur- thermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human annotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation for RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end distribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we can see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\n\n\n\n\nDistribution shift of SFT to RHLF models\n\n\n\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the best annotators may not chart. Nonetheless, humans can still provide valuable feedback when comparing two answers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished artists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of LLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as documented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold standard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”\n\nWe may be entering an era where supervised data (human generated text) for supervised fine-tuning is no longer as useful as model-generated text from the most powerful models like GPT-4. Andrej Karpathy made a similar argument in his talk (State of GPT at around 17:00) saying that its easier for humans to compare two completions (what one does when creating training data for the reward model) vs. creating a completion from scratch (what one does when creating training data for the SFT model). This idea that model-generated text becoming more useful than human generated text reminds me of Microsoft’s paper Orca (Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4). Eric Hartford recently released an open source implementation of Orca based on Llama1, excited to see what he can do with Llama2."

For creative prompts, the RHLF models continue to generate diverse completions. However for factual prompts, the RHLF models learn to generate similar completions.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in temperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the Self-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model. On the other hand, for prompts based on factual information, such as “What is the capital of ?” the Self-BLEU slope diminishes over time. This pattern suggests that despite the rising temperature, the model learns to consistently provide the same response to factual prompts.\n\nIt’s not clear to me why temperature here can be above 1.\n\n\n\nRHLF learns to adapt temperature to type of prompt"

These examples included questions like “How long ago did Barack Obama become president?” Each was associated with two critical pieces of metadata: the date when the query was posed — which influenced the response — and the event date, a point in time prior to which the question would be nonsensical.

He suggests thinking about AI automating specific tasks within jobs rather than entire jobs being automated.\nFor many jobs, if AI automates 20-30% of the tasks, the job may still be reasonably safe, though people using AI will likely replace those who don’t use AI tools.\nHe sees customer service roles like call centers and sales operations being among the most disrupted and automated by AI in the near-term.\nKnowledge workers can get an immediate productivity boost from using AI tools like generative AI, but some reskilling and training is needed to use AI responsibly.\nWhile acknowledging there will be some job displacement, Ng seems optimistic that the productivity gains from AI will create new opportunities as well, similar to past technological transitions. He encourages being proactive in managing this transition well.\n\nAndrew Ng identified customer service jobs and sales operations jobs as most at risk of being automated. Klarna had news last week where they have developed a customer service AI powered by OpenAI that already handles two-thirds of Klarna’s customer service chats, generating an estimated $40M in profit. See the statistics below for the comparisons:\n\n\n\nKlarna\n\n\nTeleperformance is a French company that runs call centers, lost 20% of their marketcap or $1.7B of value the moment Klarna made the above announcement.\n\n\n\nTeleperformance\n\n\nThey lost an additional 20% of their market cap yesterday when they released earnings. It’s staggering this one organization has lost 40% of their value over the past month. I imagine this will continue to play out as AI continues to make it’s way through automating different tasks and different functions. The hope is these call center workers at Klarna and other companies will be able to re-skill and find other opportunities."

They begin by discussing the early stages of their research, which focused on various loss functions and optimization techniques for word embedding representations. A key discovery from this period was the effectiveness of the skip-gram model in comparison to other models they evaluated. This led to a concentrated effort on enhancing the skip-gram model, including improvements in optimization and the introduction of phrase embeddings. Ilya, a later addition to their team, contributed significantly to the paper’s influence.\nThroughout the talk, Jeff and Greg highlight several key learnings from their work. They emphasize the importance of semi-supervised objectives in natural language understanding, noting the potential of semi-supervised learning to leverage large, unlabeled data sets for constructing supervised-like training data. Another significant point is the superiority of fast, parallel, and weakly supervised computation over more tightly synchronized approaches, which has become a dominant trend in machine learning. They also discuss the relevance of tokenization in solving nuanced problems and the unexpected power of treating language as sequences of dense vectors.\nJeff and Greg conclude by revisiting the main themes of their research and its current relevance. They acknowledge the shift in ML towards more synchronized approaches but foresee a potential resurgence of asynchronous methods for training large models. They also touch on the evolution of tokenization methods and the continued significance of representing language through dense vectors. The podcast ends with an acknowledgment of their co-authors and a mention of the “Test of Time” award, suggesting the sequence-to-sequence paper as a likely winner for its influence on language models.

The paper has been widely cited, with source code and trained representations being used by many in various applications. Key themes from this work include the powerful potential of semi-supervised objectives, treating language as a sequence of dense vectors, and the effective use of weakly synchronized, asynchronous updates to scale large models. The paper also explores how tokenization can be utilized for solving nuanced problems and highlights the importance of focusing compute on aspects that need improvement.

    "text": "Emergence Mirage\n\ngpt-4\nThe podcast transcript covers a presentation on the paper “Our Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models, a Mirage,” co-authored by Brando Miranda and Professor Sanmi Koyejo. The paper critically examines the concept of “emergent abilities” in large language models (LLMs), which refers to capabilities that appear in larger models but are absent in smaller ones. These abilities were thought to be unpredictable based on the performance of smaller models. The authors argue, however, that these emergent abilities might not be due to fundamental changes in model scale but rather the result of the metrics used to evaluate these models.\nThe paper challenges the notion of emergent abilities by proposing that the way models are evaluated, especially using harsh, non-linear metrics like exact match or multiple-choice grade, may create an illusion of emergent abilities. They suggest that if metrics were more continuous and linear, like edit distance or Breyer’s score, the scaling of model performance would appear more predictable and less like emergent phenomena.\nTo support their hypothesis, the authors conducted three types of evidence: predictions using the GPT-3 model, a meta-analysis of published metrics and emergent abilities at Google’s Big Bench, and an experiment inducing emergent abilities in small networks on vision tasks. Their findings suggest that emergent abilities could be more a matter of evaluation methodology than a fundamental property of large-scale models.\nThe podcast concludes with reflections on the paper’s reception. Despite its recognition as the best paper, there’s a hint of skepticism about its impact on the field. It’s suggested that while the paper is notable and well-executed, it might not have fundamentally altered understandings or practices in the field of machine learning, primarily addressing methodological issues rather than denying the existence of emergent phenomena in large language models.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: The discussed podcast presents research on predictability and surprise in large language models, specifically addressing the concept of emergent abilities. This study, conducted by Brando Miranda and Professor Sanmi Koyejo, challenges the narrative around sudden improvements in model performance at seemingly unpredictable scales. It argues that these emergent abilities might not be due to fundamental changes in the models but rather a result of how we evaluate them.\nThe researchers propose an alternative hypothesis where they demonstrate that non-linear and discontinuous evaluation metrics can create the illusion of emergent abilities. They provide evidence from GPT-3, Google’s Big Bench, and toy minuscule networks on vision tasks to support their claim. The paper highlights the importance of considering scaling properties, evaluation data quality, and specific metrics when predicting changes in model capabilities with increasing scale. Despite being a notable contribution to the field, its impact as the “best paper” is questioned due to not directly denying emergence’s existence but rather pointing out methodological disagreements."

Eric, Raphael, and Archit explain that the emergence of models like GPT-3 and Chad GPT highlighted the importance of RLHF, which aligns model behavior with human expectations and desires.\nThe traditional RLHF pipeline involves two main steps: first, collecting a dataset of preferences (prompt and response pairs) and training a reward model based on these preferences, and second, optimizing a policy to maximize rewards while staying close to the initial supervised model. This process, typically employing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), is complex and resource-intensive.\nDPO, in contrast, aims to streamline this process by finding a closed-form optimal solution for the optimization set up for RLHF. It utilizes the concept of the Boltzmann distribution to reweight the reference distribution by the exponentiated reward. DPO fits a reward model to preference data, skipping the reinforcement learning process altogether. The key to DPO is its use of a specific parameterization for the reward model, which directly yields the optimal policy for the RLHF objective without requiring a separate reinforcement learning step.\nTheir experiments show that DPO offers better reward-divergence trade-offs than PPO and other RL-free approaches, demonstrating its efficiency and stability across various tasks, including summarization and dialogue. Interestingly, DPO also shows comparable or better generalization capabilities than PPO-trained policies, even with limited training data.\nThe podcast concludes with the observation that while DPO is simpler, cheaper, and easier to train than PPO, there is some skepticism about its performance in terms of alignment and benchmark results compared to PPO-trained models. However, the potential benefits of DPO, especially in terms of computational efficiency, make it a noteworthy development in the field of machine learning and language model training.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary:"

    "text": "DPO Poster Session\n\ngpt-4\nThe podcast discusses Direct Reference Optimization (DPO), an algorithm designed to simplify Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). DPO streamlines the traditional RLHF pipeline, which is complex and hard to implement due to its reliance on reinforcement learning (RL) processes. RLHF, used in models like Chat GPT, starts with a base model and adds human preference data (pairwise comparisons of completions) to train a reward model. This model is then used to generate completions that maximize expected reward under a KL constraint to stay close to the initial distribution, preventing model degeneration.\nDPO’s contribution lies in providing an exact optimal solution for this optimization problem. It reweights the reference distribution by exponentiating the reward, a concept derived from the Boltzmann distribution. The DPO approach involves rewriting the reward in terms of the policy itself, using a specific algebraic rearrangement. This results in a classification loss directly in terms of the fine-tuned policy, thereby eliminating the need for a separate RL optimization process.\nThe podcast reveals that DPO is advantageous because it requires only one step and uses the same preference dataset as RLHF. Experiments show DPO works effectively on real-world datasets, offering comparable or better results than PPO with greater efficiency. Additionally, the speaker discusses the developmental process of the paper, mentioning the crucial input from Chelsea Finn, and the inspiration behind the idea, emphasizing the advantages of removing steps in sequential learning. While DPO has shown promise, there are still areas for further research, particularly regarding its application in scenarios where reward models are trained on more complex datasets than binary pairwise preferences.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: So we’re going to talk about the scaling laws here, but also what they did with their data augmentation techniques, which is a very interesting part of this paper as well."

    "text": "Datablations\n\ngpt-4\nThe podcast features Niklas presenting a study on “Scaling Data-Constrained Language Models.” The premise of the work is the increasing scarcity of high-quality language data, such as academic papers and books, and explores solutions for training large language models (LLMs) under data constraints. The study challenges the common practice in LLM training of avoiding data repetition, a norm in models like GPT-3 and Palm.\nThe research examines the effects of training for multiple epochs with repeated data. Initial findings indicate that training for a few epochs with repeated data yields similar performance to training with unique data. However, as the number of epochs increases, performance diverges negatively. This suggests that repeating data up to a certain limit (around four epochs) is feasible for scaling LLMs within existing data constraints.\nThe study also explores how to allocate computational resources when repeating data. Contrary to previous findings (such as those from the Chinchilla study), which recommend equal scaling of model size and training data, this research suggests that data should be scaled faster in repeated regimes. They demonstrate that models with fewer parameters trained for more epochs perform better both in terms of loss and downstream performance.\nAdditionally, the study investigates complementary strategies for data constraints, such as incorporating code data from sources like GitHub and employing filtering strategies like fuzzy deduplication and perplexity filtering. These methods show promise in improving model performance, even when repeating data.\nNiklas concludes with key takeaways: Repeating data for up to four epochs is generally effective, adding code data can be beneficial even for natural language tasks, and quality filtering combined with data repetition can yield superior results compared to using the original dataset alone. He also highlights the practical application of these findings in training large language models, like FinGBT, a Finnish language model.\nThe podcast host remarks on the surprising finding that training up to four epochs is nearly as effective as using new data, challenging the notion that “One Epoch is All You Need.” The host appreciates the study’s contribution to open-source AI research, particularly noting Hugging Face’s exemplary work in documenting and sharing their research and methodologies.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary:"

    "text": "QLoRA\n\ngpt-4\nIn the podcast, Tim Detmers presents QLORA, an efficient method for fine-tuning quantized large language models (LLMs). The key innovation of QLORA is its ability to compress neural networks to 4-bit while maintaining 16-bit performance, making it possible for regular researchers to fine-tune large language models without needing extensive GPU resources.\nQLORA’s approach involves quantization, where a 32-bit float number is compressed to a 4-bit integer. This process involves slicing the distribution of values into 16 slices or bins, each representing a quantization bin. The main challenge in quantization is minimizing quantization errors to avoid degrading neural network performance.\nIn terms of fine-tuning costs, Detmers explains the high memory requirements for traditional methods, especially for models with billions of parameters. QLORA significantly reduces this footprint by quantizing the pre-trained model to 4-bit and adding adapters, which leads to a much smaller memory requirement, making it feasible to fine-tune on consumer-grade GPUs.\nQLORA introduces several innovations, including a 4-bit normal float data type that is information-theoretically optimal and a double quantization technique for further memory reduction. In experiments, QLORA replicated 16-bit performance with 4-bit quantization across various models and datasets.\nThe podcast also highlights the development of Gonako, a high-quality chatbot created using QLORA. Gonako was fine-tuned on a single consumer GPU for 24 hours and compared favorably with other chatbots like ChatGPT in a tournament-style setup judged by humans and GPT-4.\nDetmers concludes by noting that QLORA makes fine-tuning 18 times cheaper and has been integrated into the Hugging Face Transformer stack, making it accessible for widespread use. He also mentions his availability on the academic job market and an upcoming talk on the making of QLORA. The podcast then transitions to discussing the benefits of attending conferences like NeurIPS, where attendees can discover new and lesser-known research efforts.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: So let’s hear about it from the horse’s mouth. Today, I will present our work on Datacomp, a new approach to multimodal learning that combines data-driven and model-based methods. Our goal is to enable models to learn to generate images conditioned on text descriptions in a data-efficient manner. To achieve this, we propose an algorithm that iteratively improves the quality of generated images by combining data-driven and model-based approaches. Data-driven methods train generative models using large amounts of paired image-text data. However, collecting such data is expensive and time consuming. Model-based methods generate images conditioned on text descriptions by optimizing latent codes with gradient descent. These methods can be trained without any paired data, but they often produce low quality results due to the difficulty of optimizing high dimensional spaces. Our approach combines these two approaches to improve image generation quality while reducing the need for paired data. We first train a model-based generator using an unpaired dataset of images and text descriptions. Then we use this generator to create synthetic paired data by generating images conditioned on text prompts. Next, we fine-tune a diffusion model with this synthetic data. Finally, we improve the quality of generated images by optimizing latent codes with gradient descent using the fine-tuned diffusion model as an oracle. Our experiments show that our approach improves image generation quality compared to both data-driven and model-based methods alone. We also demonstrate that our method can generate high quality results even when trained on a small number of real paired examples, making it more data efficient than purely data-driven approaches. In this talk, I will first introduce the problem of multimodal learning and discuss existing approaches to text-to-image generation. Then I will present our Datacomp algorithm in detail. Finally, I will show experimental results comparing our approach to baselines. Multimodal learning aims to enable machines to understand and generate information across different modalities such as images, audio, and text. One important application of multimodal learning is text-to-image generation, where the goal is to generate an image given a natural language description. This task has received significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various domains such as art, education, and gaming. Existing approaches to text-to-image generation can be broadly categorized into two main groups– data-driven methods and model-based methods. Data-driven methods learn a generative model by training on large datasets of paired image-text examples. These methods have achieved impressive results in recent years, but they require a significant amount of labeled data to train effectively. Collecting such data can be expensive and time consuming. Model-based methods, on the other hand, generate images conditioned on text descriptions by optimizing latent codes with gradient descent. These methods do not require any paired data for training, but they often produce low quality results due to the difficulty of optimizing high dimensional spaces. Our approach combines these two approaches to improve image generation quality while reducing the need for paired data. We first train a model-based generator using an unpaired dataset of images and text descriptions. Then we use this generator to create synthetic paired data by generating images conditioned on text prompts. Next, we fine-tune a diffusion model with this synthetic data. Finally, we improve the quality of generated images by optimizing latent codes with gradient descent using the fine-tuned diffusion model as an oracle. Let’s dive into our approach in more detail. Our algorithm consists of three main steps– pretraining a model-based generator, creating synthetic paired data, and fine-tuning a diffusion model. In the first step, we train a model-based generator using an unpaired dataset of images and text descriptions. We use CLIP to align the image and text encoders during training. This helps the generator to produce images that are relevant to the given text prompt. Next, we create synthetic paired data by generating images conditioned on text prompts using our pretrained model-based generator. These synthetic examples can be used to fine-tune a diffusion model in the next step. We use few real paired examples as additional supervision during fine-tuning to improve the quality of generated images. Finally, we optimize latent codes with gradient descent using the fine-tuned diffusion model as an oracle to further refine the generated images. Our experiments show that our approach improves image generation quality compared to both data-driven and model-based methods alone. We also demonstrate that our method can generate high quality results even when trained on a small number of real paired examples, making it more data efficient than purely data-driven approaches. In conclusion, we presented Datacomp, a new approach to multimodal learning that combines data-driven and model-based methods to improve image generation quality while reducing the need for paired data. Our experiments show promising results, highlighting the potential of our method in improving text-to-image generation. Thank you. [APPLAUSE]"

They emphasize the evolution from traditional supervised datasets, which required creating new datasets for new tasks, to the more flexible image-text datasets enabling open vocabulary models capable of various classification tasks.\nDatacomp proposes a shift from the standard machine learning pipeline, which focuses on iterating on model architectures, to iterating on datasets instead. The core of Datacomp is a benchmark for dataset development, especially focusing on the CLIP training regime for image-text datasets. CLIP uses a text encoder and an image encoder trained contrastively to align image and text representations.\nDatacomp’s workflow comprises five steps: choosing a scale, selecting data, training a model, evaluating, and submitting results. It offers flexibility in data selection, allowing participants to filter from a provided raw data pool or bring additional data. The workflow uses fixed training recipes for CLIP training and evaluates models on a suite of 38 downstream tasks.\nGabriel discusses experiments with different baselines, particularly focusing on clip score filtering and image-based filtering. The best-performing baseline, DataComp1B, is a 1.4 billion sample subset of the data pool, showing higher accuracy than existing datasets, including OpenAI’s. This demonstrates that carefully selecting and filtering smaller data subsets can yield better performance than using larger, noisier datasets.\nDataComp encourages community participation, even for those with limited computational resources. It is fully open source, with resources including a website, codebase, and paper available for anyone interested. The project represents a significant step in refining dataset creation and selection, shifting the focus in LLM training from merely scaling models to designing more effective datasets.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nIn this podcast, Samir, Gabriel, and Alex discuss their paper “Datacomp: In Search of the Next Generation of Multimodal Datasets.” They explain how traditional computer vision models have been improved through specialized data sets, but this process can be laborious. The paradigm shifted to image text datasets that allowed for open-vocabulary trading models, enabling downstream tasks like image classification. However, the standard machine learning pipeline remained consistent: create a monolithic artifact (data set), keep it fixed, and iterate on model training. They introduce Data Comp as a benchmark for data set development to understand how data set decisions improve models. This focuses on CLIP trading regimes for modern image text datasets, where they fix the CLIP bit and iterate on data selection processes to create new data sets for CLIP model training. The Data Comp workflow consists of five steps: choosing a scale, selecting data, training a model, evaluating, and submitting results. Participants can use their data selection method on either a fixed provided pool or bring in additional data. They then train a model using a fixed recipe with hyperparameters for CLIP training. Models are evaluated using a suite of 38 downstream tasks, and the final step is to submit results. The authors study various baselines, including clip score filtering and image-based filtering, which they intersect to create DataComp1B, a data set that outperforms existing data sets like OpenAI’s WIT and Lion2B at no extra cost during training time. They find smaller, more aggressively filtered data sets can perform better than larger ones from the same pool, and the ranking of filtering strategies is relatively stable across scales. Data Comp encourages experimentation with data sets to improve performance on downstream models, potentially becoming a new standard like ImageNet."

The team, comprising individuals from various universities and corporations, was brought together by Ludwig, known for his networking and openness to collaboration. Datacomp began as a benchmark for dataset development, focusing on the CLIP training regime, but evolved into a community-building initiative around dataset curation.\nThe Datacomp workflow consists of five steps: choosing a scale, selecting data, training a model, evaluating, and submitting results. Participants can filter data from a provided raw pool or bring in additional data. The project emphasizes dataset selection’s impact on model performance, encouraging experimentation with different data curation methods.\nThe team conducted over 300 pre-training experiments with various filtering strategies. One successful approach involved intersecting clip score filtering and image-based filtering to create DataComp1B, a 1.4 billion sample dataset that outperforms existing datasets. Their findings suggest smaller, carefully curated datasets can be more effective than larger, noisier ones.\nDatacomp aims to shift the focus from scaling models to designing better datasets. It encourages participation from the broader community, even those with limited computational resources. Everything related to Datacomp, including tools for dataset curation, is open source, facilitating collaboration and further research in data-centric AI.\nThe podcast also touches on the potential of extending Datacomp’s approach to other fields like NLP, audio, video, and even MRI images. The idea is to fix the model and allow researchers to experiment with selecting subsets from a data pool, a shift from the traditional approach of building multiple models for a fixed dataset. This approach is seen as foundational, akin to a new ImageNet, potentially marking a significant moment in the development of multimodal models.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: So, let’s listen in on this podcast about Lava.\nIn the transcript, a PhD student from Columbia discusses their involvement in Data Comp, an extensive project aimed at creating a thorough and large-scale benchmark for data curation. The team collaborated with various researchers from different institutions to generate 12.8 billion image-text pairs and conduct numerous evaluations on multiple downstream tasks. This significant effort was driven by the desire to create a high-quality benchmark, which led them to work at an unprecedented scale for academics.\nThe project attracted participation from various universities and corporations due to Ludwig, one of the authors, being well-connected within the community. Although separate from Lyon group, many members knew each other and collaborated on this project. Initially considering using Lyon’s 12.8 billion dataset, they ultimately focused on creating a benchmark as their primary goal.\nThe Data Comp team emphasized building a community around dataset curation by open-sourcing the tools used in addition to releasing the dataset itself. This approach allows others to experiment with different tooling methods and contribute to data-centric AI development. The community is actively exploring various data set curation techniques, such as designing filtering networks, and Clip scores have been notably applied for this purpose.\nThe team also discussed potential future directions for Data Comp, including expanding its approach to audio and video, as well as creating Data Comp Lite efforts in the NLP space. They envision a future where data cleaning and filtering become first-class citizens within AI research, with models being built specifically for this purpose.\nThe conversation then briefly touched on Datacomp’s relation to Lion, an existing dataset, and how Data Comp aims to build upon it by creating a community focused on improving the curation process. The discussion concluded with mentioning Lava, an open-source visual language model that, in combination with Data Comp, could provide a template for future multimodal models’ development."

The project, called Visual Instruction Tuning, aims to create an open-source model with capabilities similar to GPT-4 Vision. Lava’s objective is to enable a model to reason about the visual world and interact through language, akin to human capabilities in various professional and social contexts.\nThe foundation of Lava lies in the integration of a visual encoder, a cross-modal connector, and a language decoder. The visual encoder processes images, the cross-modal connector bridges visual features to the language domain, and the language decoder interprets user instructions and expresses understanding through text. To generate the training data, the team leverages a text-only GPT, which interprets images contextually described in textual format. This approach utilizes image annotations and object category details from datasets like COCO to create detailed image contexts.\nLava is trained on a dataset called LavaInstruct 158k, which comprises triplets of images, instructions, and answers. The responses are designed to facilitate multi-turn engagement, focus on visual details, and enable complex reasoning beyond visual facts. The training involves two stages: pre-training the projector for feature alignment and performing end-to-end visual instruction tuning.\nPost-training, Lava exhibits several emergent properties, including strong visual reasoning capabilities and a grounding in visual facts. It demonstrates an emerging OCR capability and the ability to perform reasoning in multiple languages. Lava’s effectiveness is further validated through a challenging benchmark called Lava Bench in the Wild, which assesses knowledge beyond training data and multilingual understanding.\nHao Tian also discusses the community’s role in expanding Lava’s capabilities, highlighting its adaptability to various optimizations designed for language models.

The architecture of Lava includes a vision encoder to encode visual features, a language model for reasoning, and a projection layer, which is a linear layer, to project visual features to a latent space understandable by the language decoder. The language model used is open source, not GPT-4, and is specifically trained to understand images and follow instructions.\nThe training process of Lava involves two stages. In the first stage, only the projection layer is trained while the language model and vision encoder are frozen. In the second stage, both the language model and the projector are trained to follow multi-modal instructions. The model does not need to understand bounding boxes as it relies on visual instruction following data, which includes image, instruction, and answer.\nLava’s training data was generated using a text-only GPT, with image contexts provided in textual format, including COCO annotations and bounding box details. The model demonstrates strong visual reasoning capabilities, understanding complex visual situations, and can even perform reasoning in multiple languages.\nFor training on different multimodal instruction-following datasets, Hao Tian recommends considering the domain’s specificity. If the domain differs significantly, like medical imaging, he suggests training from scratch with a domain-specific clip, like a biomedical clip. For less divergent domains, using the instruction-tuned version of Lava is recommended due to its extensive visual knowledge.\nLava’s training is efficient and affordable, requiring less than one day on a single node. The model’s open-source nature makes it accessible for a broader community. Hao Tian demonstrates Lava’s capabilities through a live demo, where the model interprets an image from NeurIPS 2023 and drafts a relevant tweet.\nLava represents a significant advancement in visual language models, simplifying the architecture while maintaining high-level reasoning capabilities. Its ability to train quickly and effectively on diverse visual data sets, along with its adaptability to various optimization techniques, positions it as a groundbreaking contribution in the field of visual language modeling.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: So this is by Google Brain, and it’s basically an extension of the chain of thought idea where you have a model that generates a sequence of intermediate steps to solve a problem. And so in this case, they use a tree structure rather than just a linear sequence. And they do some experiments on math problems, which is kind of interesting. So I talked to one of the authors, Yuan Cao, and he explained it to me. Here’s the transcript. Basically, we propose a new framework for chain of thought generation called Tree of Thought. The key idea here is that instead of generating a linear sequence of thoughts, we generate a tree structure of thoughts. And this tree structure can be seen as a hierarchical decomposition of the final answer. So each leaf node in the tree corresponds to an atomic fact or operation. Each internal node represents a composition of its children nodes. And the root node is the final answer. So for example, if we want to solve the problem 15 divided by 3 plus 2, this can be decomposed into two steps. First, we compute 15 divided by 3 as 5. Then we add 2 to get the final answer of 7. And in our model, we generate these two steps hierarchically. So first, we generate the root node, which is 7. Then we generate the internal nodes representing the composition of its children. In this case, it’s multiply and add. Then we generate the leaf nodes corresponding to the atomic operations or facts. And in our experiments, we show that this tree structure can help improve performance on math word problems as well as some other tasks like text completion and image captioning. So how do you train this model? Yeah, so basically, we use a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we pretrain the model using an unsupervised objective. And in particular, we use the chain of thought pretraining objective proposed by OpenAI. This is to learn to generate coherent chains of thoughts. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model on supervised tasks. So for math word problems, we use a teacher forcing approach. So given an input problem, we first generate a tree using our model. Then we expand this tree into a linear sequence and feed it to GPT-3 as input. And then we use the output of GPT-3 as the supervision signal to fine-tune our model. And for other tasks like text completion and image captioning, we directly use teacher forcing on these tasks. So how does this compare with just using a linear chain of thought? Yeah, so one key difference between our approach and the original chain of thought is that in our case, we explicitly represent the hierarchical structure of thoughts. And this can help improve performance because it allows the model to learn more fine-grained atomic operations or facts. For example, for a math word problem like 15 divided by 3 plus 2 equals x, when generating a linear chain of thought, the model might generate something like 15 divided by 3 is 5, then add 2 to get the final answer of 7. But in our case, since we have an explicit hierarchical structure, the model can learn to generate more fine-grained atomic operations or facts like 15 divided by 3 is 5 and add 5 and 2 is 7. And this can help improve performance because it allows the model to learn more fine-grained atomic operations or facts. So how do you represent this tree structure? Yeah, so we use a graph neural network to encode this tree structure. And in particular, we use the Graph CodevNet architecture proposed by DeepMind. This is an efficient and powerful graph neural network architecture that can capture long range dependencies between nodes in the tree. And we also propose some new training techniques to improve the performance of our model on supervised tasks. So one key technique here is that we introduce a novel loss function called tree edit distance loss. This allows us to better align the generated tree with the ground truth tree, which can help improve performance. Another technique we use is that during fine-tuning, we dynamically expand the generated tree into a linear sequence based on the supervision signal from GPT-3 or other teacher models. And this can help improve performance because it allows the model to learn more effective intermediate steps by adapting to the specifics of each task. So how do you decide when to stop expanding? Yeah, so during fine-tuning, we dynamically expand the tree based on the supervision signal from GPT-3 or other teacher models. And in particular, if the output of our model is a leaf node and it matches with the ground truth answer, then we consider this expansion as complete. Otherwise, we continue to expand the tree until either we reach the maximum depth or we find a match between the generated intermediate step and the ground truth sequence. So what’s next for you guys? Yeah, so currently, we are exploring some extensions of our model. For example, one interesting direction is to allow the model to generate trees with different structures for different tasks. And this can help improve performance because it allows the model to learn task-specific decomposition strategies. Another direction we are interested in is to extend our approach to other types of problems like programming and physics simulations. So that’s really cool. I think that’s a very interesting idea. And I do think that there’s something to be said for having a hierarchical structure, because it does allow you to have more fine-grained intermediate steps. And so I think that is an important contribution here. But I also want to point out that this is not the only paper on chain of thought or thought generation. There were actually quite a few others. So there was one by DeepMind called Prompt Learning for Math Word Problems, which basically uses a chain of thought prompt to solve math word problems. And they use a combination of pretraining and fine-tuning. They also have some interesting techniques around how you generate the intermediate steps. There’s another paper by Meta called Chain of Thought with Inner Outer Attention, which is essentially trying to do the same thing as well. So I think that this is an area where there’s a lot of innovation happening right now. And it does seem like it’s having some impact on performance. But I also want to point out that these are all still relatively small scale experiments. And so we need to see if this can really scale up and have a significant impact when you’re dealing with much larger models or more complex tasks. So that’s something to keep an eye on. Another interesting paper in the prompting category is called Prompt-Tuning for Language Model Fine-tuning by OpenAI, which is essentially trying to do parameter efficient fine-tuning of language models using prompts. And so this is a very important topic because we want to be able to use these large language models on different tasks without having to retrain them from scratch or finetune all the parameters. So this is an interesting approach. And I talked to one of the authors, Yuan Cao again, who explained it to me. Here’s the transcript. Basically, in our work, we propose a new method for fine-tuning language models using prompts called prompt-tuning. The key idea here is that instead of finetuning all the parameters of the model, we only finetune a small set of parameters corresponding to the input tokens. And this can help improve performance while reducing the amount of computation required for fine-tuning. So in our experiments, we show that prompt-tuning can achieve competitive performance compared to full fine-tuning on various tasks like text classification and natural language inference. And it can also outperform other parameter efficient methods like prefix tuning or adapter tuning. So how do you actually perform this prompt-tuning? Yeah, so basically, during fine-tuning, we fix all the parameters of the model except for a small set of parameters corresponding to the input tokens. And these parameters are initialized as the learned prompts from pretraining. So in particular, we use the chain of thought pretraining objective proposed by OpenAI to learn these prompts. Then during fine-tuning on supervised tasks, we finetune these prompt parameters together with a small set of output parameters corresponding to the final prediction layer. And for unsupervised tasks like text completion or image captioning, we only finetune the prompt parameters. So how does this compare with other parameter efficient methods like prefix tuning or adapter tuning? Yeah, so one key difference between our approach and these other methods is that in our case, we directly learn the prompts during pretraining. And this can help improve performance because it allows the model to learn task-specific prompt patterns during pretraining. For example, for a text classification task like sentiment analysis, the learned prompt might include some keywords related to sentiment such as positive or negative. And this can help improve performance on downstream tasks because it allows the model to better focus on relevant information when generating outputs. Another key difference is that in our case, we only finetune a small set of parameters corresponding to the input tokens and the final prediction layer. And this can help reduce the amount of computation required for fine-tuning compared to full fine-tuning or other parameter efficient methods like prefix tuning or adapter tuning. So what’s next for you guys? Yeah, so currently, we are exploring some extensions of our method. For example, one interesting direction is to allow the model to learn different prompts for different tasks. And this can help improve performance because it allows the model to learn task-specific prompt patterns during pretraining. Another direction we are interested in"

    "text": "Tree of Thought\n\ngpt-4\nShen Yu from Princeton University presents “Tree of Thoughts,” a project that explores the potential and limitations of language models in problem-solving. The team, including colleagues from Princeton and Google, investigates whether language models can become general problem solvers by scaling up and using autoregressive inference. They specifically look at complex calculations and reasoning tasks that current models struggle with.\nThe project uses the game “24” as an example to demonstrate the challenges language models face in solving problems that require multi-step reasoning. They found that even advanced models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 struggle with these tasks, often producing hallucinations or incorrect solutions. The research highlights that language models make decisions token by token, left to right, without the capability for deliberate reasoning.\nTo address this, “Tree of Thoughts” introduces a system that combines language models with search algorithms for more deliberate reasoning. This approach is inspired by Daniel Kahneman’s two-system theory of cognition, where the fast and automatic ‘System 1’ handles everyday tasks, and the slow and deliberate ‘System 2’ manages more complex tasks.\nThe key elements of the “Tree of Thoughts” method are:\nDefining a ‘thought’ as a coherent piece of text that represents a move in reasoning. Using language models to generate and evaluate thoughts. Employing search algorithms to explore and maintain thoughts. In the “Game of 24,” thoughts are defined as intermediate equations, making them easier to generate and evaluate. The language models are used to propose next steps in reasoning, and these steps are then valued based on their potential to lead to a correct solution. The research incorporates a breadth-first search algorithm to explore these thoughts, significantly improving the task success rate compared to the Chain of Thought (CLT) approach.\n“Tree of Thoughts” has been applied to various reasoning challenges, including crosswords and creative story writing. The approach allows more flexible and systematic generation, evaluation, and exploration of thoughts in diverse tasks. This method represents a step towards integrating classic AI insights with modern AI technologies, suggesting the possibility of creating autonomous agents that can reason and interact with the external world.\nThe project’s success demonstrates the potential of combining old AI ideas like tree search with new language models to enhance problem-solving capabilities. The researchers encourage the audience to explore their follow-up paper, “Koala,” which delves into cognitive architectures for language agents. “Tree of Thoughts” offers a promising approach to augment the reasoning abilities of language models, paving the way for more sophisticated AI problem-solving.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: But you can recover those things as special cases of this more general idea. And it seems like that’s a really good way to go about doing research in AI, where you have these general models that you can then customize and specialize for different tasks or different effects. So I think that’s a really nice paper. In this podcast transcript, Shen Yu from Princeton discusses their joint work with colleagues on Tree of Thoughts, exploring the limitations of language models as general problem solvers through an example task. They highlight how autoregressive inference lacks mechanisms for deliberate reasoning and introduces a new method called Tree of Thoughts to combine language models and search algorithms for improved reasoning. This approach defines thoughts as coherent pieces of text, generates them using language models, and combines them with a search algorithm for exploration and maintenance. The podcast presents various examples, including Game of 24, crossword puzzles, and creative story writing, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method across diverse tasks without requiring model retraining."

    "text": "Tree of Thought Poster Session\n\ngpt-4\nThe presenter, Shen Yu from Princeton, discusses their paper “Tree of Thoughts,” which examines the interplay between large language models and search algorithms. The paper identifies a limitation in current large language models, like GPT-4, when solving complex reasoning tasks. For example, in the game “24,” where players combine four numbers to make 24, these models struggle due to their autoregressive, token-by-token decision-making process without look-ahead or backtrack capabilities.\nTo address this, “Tree of Thoughts” proposes a method that combines the generative power of language models with the structured exploration of search algorithms. The approach defines a ‘thought’ as an intermediate step in reasoning, which can be generated and evaluated using language models, and then systematically explored with tree search algorithms. This method allows for more deliberate reasoning and significantly improves task performance without requiring new model training.\nIn their experiments, they demonstrate how “Tree of Thoughts” can be applied to various tasks, like the game “24” and crossword puzzles, achieving much better results than traditional approaches. For example, in the game “24,” using Tree of Thoughts with a breadth-first search algorithm increased task success from 4% (using Chain of Thought) to 74%.\nThe paper also explores creative writing tasks, showing that Tree of Thoughts can enhance the creativity of language model outputs by allowing for step-by-step planning and evaluation of different writing plans.\nShen Yu highlights the interdisciplinary nature of their work at Princeton NLP, combining ideas from different fields like cognitive science and classical search. The “Tree of Thoughts” approach represents a significant advancement in leveraging the capabilities of language models for more complex, deliberate reasoning tasks, opening up new possibilities for AI problem-solving.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: And here’s a bit of our chat with the first author of that paper, Yuan Cao from Google Brain. So what we did is we created a new benchmark called ToolBench. And it consists of 10 different tasks. Each task requires using one specific tool in order to solve it. For example, one task is called Wikipedia link prediction. In this task, you’re given two entities, like Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. Your job is to predict whether there exists a Wikipedia link between these two entities or not. And the way to solve this problem is by using the Wikipedia search tool. So what we did is we created a new training method called Toolformer. And it consists of three components. The first component is called tool embedding. It’s a way to learn the representation for each tool. The second component is called tool selection. It’s a way to decide which tool should be used in order to solve a given task. And the third component is called tool execution, which is a way to execute the selected tool and retrieve the information that we need from it. So what we found is that by using this new training method, we can improve the performance on our benchmark by 10 times compared to previous methods. And we also show that the model trained with Toolformer can generalize to unseen tools. For example, given a task where you need to use Google search in order to solve it, but during training time, we only used Wikipedia. So this shows that our method is able to learn some kind of tool-agnostic knowledge.\nIn this podcast transcript, the discussion revolves around a research paper exploring the complementary nature of large-language models and search algorithms. The paper highlights limitations in using large-language models alone for tasks requiring exploration, such as the game of 24, where autoregressive inference proves to be unreliable due to its lack of look-ahead and backtrack capabilities.\nTo address this issue, the researchers propose defining a search space that balances between generating intermediate steps (thoughts) and evaluating them. This approach allows for the use of large language models to generate and evaluate next moves while maintaining them using tree search algorithms. The method significantly improves task performances across various domains without requiring new model training.\nThe conversation also touches on the potential combination of this search-based approach with self-consistency, as well as an overview of Princeton NLP’s productivity and interdisciplinary collaborations. Additionally, the discussion briefly mentions another paper, Toolformer, which focuses on training language models to use tools effectively by introducing a new benchmark called ToolBench and a new training method called Toolformer. This approach results in a 10x improvement in performance compared to previous methods while demonstrating generalization capabilities for unseen tools."

    "text": "Toolformer\n\ngpt-4\nJane, a researcher from FAIR Labs at Meta, presented the “Toolformer” paper, which focuses on enabling language models like ChatGPT to use external tools. The motivation behind Toolformer is to address the limitations of language models in accessing real-time data or performing accurate computations. To achieve this, Toolformer utilizes five different tools: a QA system with up-to-date information, a Wikipedia search tool, a calculator, a calendar, and a translation tool.\nThe training process of Toolformer involves creating a new dataset augmented with API calls. The API calls are generated using prompts that encourage the model to ask questions relevant to the text. The generated API calls are then executed and embedded back into the training data. This process also includes filtering out irrelevant or unhelpful API calls based on their usefulness in reducing model perplexity.\nAfter fine-tuning GPT-J with this augmented dataset, the resulting model, Toolformer, demonstrated superior performance compared to both its base model GPT-J and GPT-3 in various tasks. These tasks included fact completion, question answering, math computations, and multilingual questions. Toolformer’s effectiveness was notable even in smaller model sizes, with a significant improvement observed in models with at least 775 million parameters.\nMoreover, an evaluation of Toolformer’s core language modeling capabilities showed that the introduction of API calls did not disrupt its performance. This suggests that the model can effectively integrate tool usage while maintaining its fundamental language processing abilities.\nFinally, Jane mentioned that despite Toolformer’s success, the Voyager paper from NVIDIA, another prominent work in language model architecture, did not receive as much attention as expected at NeurIPS. She encouraged attendees to explore both Toolformer and Voyager for their foundational contributions to language model development.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: , and posters that are worth checking out this year.

    "section": "Voyager",
    "text": "Voyager\n\ngpt-4\nGuanzhi Wang, a third-year PhD student at Caltech and a research intern at NVIDIA, presented “Voyager,” an innovative project that integrates large language models with embodied agents in the Minecraft environment. Voyager, powered by GPT-4, showcases the ability to play Minecraft autonomously for extended periods, engaging in various activities like exploration, mining, crafting, and combat. The key challenge addressed by Voyager is converting the multi-modal Minecraft environment into a text-based format, achieved using Mineflayer, a JavaScript API with access to game states.\nVoyager consists of three primary components: a coding module that writes JavaScript code to control the game bot, a code base acting as a skill library, and a curriculum that proposes tasks based on the agent’s capabilities. The coding module generates executable actions, and the skill library stores successful codes for future use, avoiding redundant efforts. The curriculum, driven by an unsupervised objective to maximize novel item acquisition, evolves progressively, guiding the agent’s learning journey.\nA notable feature of Voyager is its iterative prompting mechanism, which refines programs through feedback from the environment, JavaScript execution errors, and self-reflection by another GPT-4 model. This process enables Voyager to efficiently debug and improve its programs. The agent’s skill library, authored by GPT-4 through trial and error, allows Voyager to reuse previously learned skills, enhancing its efficiency and learning capabilities.\nVoyager demonstrates impressive performance in Minecraft, outperforming previous methods in acquiring novel items and exploring the game world. The agent’s ability to navigate diverse terrains and engage in various tasks without human intervention highlights its advanced autonomous capabilities. Despite its current limitation of not supporting visual perception, Voyager’s architecture offers a foundation for future development of multimodal models capable of more complex tasks.\nIn addition to Voyager, the session highlighted “COG eval” by Ida Mumenijad from Microsoft Research, an underrated benchmark paper presented engagingly and interactively. COG eval proposes a quantifiable benchmark for assessing reasoning and planning capabilities in language models, framing problems as graph challenges to generalize reasoning, planning, and search tasks. Although COG eval does not offer solutions, it sets a benchmark for future research in language model capabilities.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: So this is the COG eval benchmark. It’s a new evaluation framework for reasoning and planning in language models. And it’s inspired by the COG test, which is a cognitive test for humans. And so they have a bunch of different tasks. They have 10 different tasks that are categorized into three main categories– causal reasoning, temporal reasoning, and plan execution. So let me walk through each one of these. Causal reasoning is about understanding the cause and effect relationships between events. Temporal reasoning is about understanding the order in which things happen. And then plan execution is about generating a sequence of actions to achieve some goal. So for causal reasoning, they have four tasks. The first task is called “Cause-Effect.” It’s about identifying the cause or effect from a given pair of statements. The second task is called “Cause-Effect Chain,” where you have multiple events in a chain and you need to identify which event caused some other event downstream. The third task is called “Counterfactual Reasoning.” So this is about understanding what would happen if something else were different. And the fourth task is called “Inverse Causality,” where you’re given an effect, and then you have to generate a cause that could lead to that effect. For temporal reasoning, they have two tasks. The first one is called “Temporal Ordering.” So this is about identifying which event happened before or after another event. And the second task is called “Future Prediction,” where you’re given some events and then you need to predict what will happen next. And for plan execution, they have four tasks. The first one is called “Plan Completion.” It’s about completing a partially specified plan to achieve a goal. The second task is called “Plan Generation.” So this is about generating a full plan from scratch to achieve some goal. The third task is called “Plan Evaluation,” where you need to evaluate whether the given plan will lead to achieving the desired goal or not. And then the fourth task is called “Plan Repair,” where you’re given a broken plan and then you have to fix it so that it achieves the desired goal. So they have these 10 tasks, which are categorized into three main categories– causal reasoning, temporal reasoning, and plan execution. And they have a total of 24,000 examples across all these tasks. They use GPT-3 as their baseline model. And they find that the performance is quite low for all the tasks. So in general, language models are not very good at reasoning and planning. And this is something that we’ve known for a while. But it’s nice to have a benchmark where you can actually quantify how bad they are at these things. And then she also shows some of her proposed solutions, which I think are interesting. So one solution is called “Graph-based Reasoning.” It’s about representing the problem as a graph and then using graph neural networks to reason about that graph. And this is something that we’ve seen before in other papers, where they represent problems as graphs and then use GNNs to solve them. But it’s nice to see that being applied here for reasoning and planning tasks. Another solution that she proposes is called “Prompt Engineering.” So this is about designing better prompts to elicit better performance from language models. And she shows some examples of how they can improve the performance by using different types of prompts. And then finally, she also proposes a new model architecture called “Planner-in-Decoder,” which is about incorporating planning capabilities directly into the decoder of the language model. So this is something that I think is quite interesting because it’s trying to improve the reasoning and planning capabilities of language models without having to train them from scratch, but rather just adding some additional components on top of existing language models. And so these are some of the solutions that she proposes. But again, this is a benchmark paper, so there’s no one solution that she’s proposing as being the best. It’s more about introducing this new evaluation framework and showing how poor the performance currently is for language models on these reasoning and planning tasks. So I think it’s an interesting paper because it’s something that we know is a weakness of current language models, but now we have a quantifiable benchmark to measure their performance in this area. And then it also opens up opportunities for future research into improving the reasoning and planning capabilities of these models. NeurIPS 2022: The Anatomy of Autonomy In this episode, Ilya Sutskever shares his NeurIPS 2022 keynote presentation where he discusses recent breakthroughs in AI research and their implications for the future of autonomy. He covers topics such as chain-of-thought reasoning, tool use, planning, and embodiment."

    "section": "CogEval",
    "text": "CogEval\n\ngpt-4\nIn her presentation at NeurIPS, Ida Mumenijad, with 15 years of experience in reinforcement learning, cognitive science, and neuroscience, introduced COG eval, a systematic protocol for evaluating cognitive capacities in agents. COG eval is designed to operationalize latent abilities through multiple tasks in different structures, domains, and conditions, ensuring the accurate measurement of the targeted cognitive ability without confounding factors.\nThe protocol involves six different graph structures and tasks in spatial and social domains, with 15 distinct tasks inspired by Edward Tolman’s work on cognitive maps. The goal is to systematically assess whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can extract cognitive maps from environment descriptions and use them for planning and problem-solving. The tasks are designed to test the models’ robustness and flexibility in planning, particularly in response to local changes in the environment.\nMumenijad’s evaluation reveals that LLMs, including GPT-4, struggle with planning tasks. In various graph structures, the models often misinterpret or hallucinate edges, fail to follow logical paths, and demonstrate poor performance in tasks requiring accurate and flexible planning. The failure modes include creating loops in shortest paths and incorrectly stitching together one-step tuples, indicating limitations in the models’ planning capabilities.\nThe presentation also touched on the potential improvements to LLMs’ planning abilities through additional instructions, such as describing breadth-first and depth-first search methods. However, even with this extra guidance, the models showed limited improvement, particularly in complex scenarios like finding shortest paths between distant clusters.\nOverall, Mumenijad’s presentation at NeurIPS highlighted the need for better planning capabilities in LLMs, underscoring the current limitations and suggesting directions for future research and development in this area.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: this is it. NeurIPS 2022: A Recap of the Conference in Podcast Form (Part 3) In this third part of our NeurIPS 2022 recap podcast series, we cover a variety of topics including: - The challenges and limitations of LLMs in planning tasks, as discussed by Dr. Nada Lavrac from UC San Diego. - A prefrontal cortex-inspired modular architecture for solving complex problems using GPT-4. - State space models and their significance, as presented by Chris Ray from Stanford University."

    "text": "State Space Models\n\ngpt-4\nChris Ray, in his NeurIPS 2023 presentation, discussed the motivation and development of new models that efficiently handle long sequences, a challenge for standard models like transformers which scale quadratically with sequence length. His real motivation was exploring the inductive bias issue: understanding if machines need spatial inductive bias to reason like humans. Ray highlighted Long Range Arena, a benchmark for evaluating efficient attention in models, showcasing how various linear attention variants perform on tasks like image classification (Sequential CIFAR) and PathX.\nThe focus then shifted to signal processing and the use of state-space models (SSMs) in deep learning. He introduced S4, a simple yet powerful state-space model, inspired by signal processing ideas, that unifies CNN and RNN models. Ray emphasized the importance of stability in these models, which can be ensured by maintaining certain eigenvalue structures. Practical challenges like implementing these models efficiently and maintaining their stability were addressed.\nRay also pointed out the limitations of S4 in language tasks, evidenced by its higher perplexity compared to transformers. To address this, they analyzed the model’s performance on tasks requiring multi-query lookups, finding that attention models handle such tasks with fewer dimensions than convolutional models. Recent advancements like Mamba and Based have closed the gap with attention models in language tasks, suggesting that removing attention doesn’t fundamentally limit model performance.\nFinally, Ray explored the future potential of AI systems, emphasizing the rapid progress in model inference and the distinction between low-latency and high-throughput systems. He highlighted the broad spectrum of opportunities in AI and systems research, from programming models to accelerator hardware, underlying the importance of efficient, scalable models in various applications. The talk concluded with an encouragement to explore the full potential of AI in system design and implementation.\n\n\nsolar-10.7b\nSummary: and it’s a lot of music.\nan algorithmic music. a little bit, so we’re talking about the music, but it’s a lot of music, and that’s an algorithmic music, and it’s a lot of music.

    "title": "Useful Applications (mostly for Mac)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this blog post, I’ll introduce you to a list of useful applications, covering both developer tools and productivity applications that I’ve found useful over the years. I’ll also provide you with a brief overview of each app, including its key features and how it can help you improve your workflow. This is mostly Mac focused, though some of these are available on other operating systems.\n\nProductivity\nGoogle Chrome: I’ve tried other browsers but I still find myself going back to Chrome.\nWorkflowy: A simple yet powerful app for note-taking, outlining, and task management, Workflowy helps you organize your thoughts and projects using nested lists and intuitive keyboard shortcuts. It’s simple at it’s core as Workflowy is essentially an infinitely nested bulleted list. They’ve added additional features over the years like mirroring lists which I’ve found helpful. Notion may have more features but I haven’t overcome the intertia needed to switch yet.\nTodoist: A great multi platform to-do list app. One of my favorite features is being able to type dates and/or times that Todoist will parse into a due date. Because of my poor memory, I need to write everything down. If it’s task-related, it will go into Todoist. On a related note, the Reminders app on an Apple Watch is also useful for capturing todos on the go. I hold the crown to activate Siri and say “Remind me to do X at tomorrow at 10pm” and this reminder will pop-up at tomorrow 10pm on my iPhone.\nRectangle: A window management app for macOS, Rectangle enables you to quickly and effortlessly resize and organize your windows using keyboard shortcuts or by dragging windows to screen edges. Iused to use ShiftIt which did something similar but Rectangle does the same thing but works on the latest versions of macOS.\nStats: An open-source system monitor for macOS, Stats provides you with detailed information on your CPU, memory, disk, network, and battery usage, all accessible from your menu bar. I used to pay for iStat Menus but stats is an open source version.\nAmphetamine: Keep your Mac awake and prevent it from sleeping with Amphetamine, a powerful and customizable app that allows you to set rules based on applications, time, or power source. Similar to the Caffiene app.\nBe Focused: A productivity-enhancing time management app, Be Focused utilizes the Pomodoro Technique to help you break work into manageable intervals, maintain focus, and stay on track. I find using Pomodoros, setting 25 minute timers of focused work to be incredibly helpful.\nHidden Bar: A minimalist app that allows you to declutter your Mac’s menu bar by hiding icons you don’t need to see all the time, Hidden Bar lets you access these icons with a simple click whenever needed.\n1Password: A reliable password manager. Been using it since version 5.\n\n\nDeveloper Tools\nHomebrew: A must-have package manager for macOS, Homebrew makes it easy to install, update, and manage software packages, including command-line tools and graphical applications.\nVisual Studio Code: A versatile and free source code editor developed by Microsoft, Visual Studio Code supports a wide range of programming languages and comes with built-in support for Git, intelligent code completion, and a plethora of extensions to customize your coding environment.\niTerm2: A highly customizable and feature-rich terminal emulator for macOS, iTerm2 improves upon the default Terminal app with features like split panes, search functionality, and extensive customization options.\nAnaconda/Miniconda: Anaconda is a powerful Python and R distribution that simplifies package management and deployment, while Miniconda is its lightweight counterpart. Both options provide you with the essential tools to set up and manage your data science and machine learning environments.\nzsh: zsh has become my bash replacement.\nOh My Zsh: Makes zsh more useful with a bunch of plugins.\nSublime Text: A sophisticated and lightning-fast text editor designed for code, markup, and prose, Sublime Text offers a sleek interface, multiple selections, and a highly extensible plugin API.\nHere’s a bash script to install all of these packages:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Install Homebrew if not already installed\nif ! command -v brew &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1; then\n  /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nfi\n\n# Update Homebrew and install required packages\nbrew update\nbrew tap homebrew/cask\nbrew tap homebrew/cask-versions\n\n# Productivity\nbrew install --cask google-chrome\nbrew install --cask workflowy\nbrew install --cask todoist\nbrew install --cask rectangle\nbrew install --cask stats\nbrew install --cask amphetamine\nbrew install --cask be-focused\nbrew install --cask hiddenbar\nbrew install --cask 1password\n# uncomment for 1password 6.8.9\n# brew install --cask https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions/master/Casks/1password6.rb\nbrew install --cask dropbox\n\n# Developer Tools\nbrew install --cask visual-studio-code\nbrew install --cask iterm2\nbrew install anaconda\nbrew install zsh\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"\nbrew install --cask sublime-text\n\necho \"Installation complete!\"\nSave the script in a file named install_apps.sh and make it executable using the following command:\nchmod +x install_apps.sh\nFinally, run the script using:\n./install_apps.sh"

He presents a complementarian view of marriage, where husbands and wives have distinct roles that work together for the good of the relationship. The seminar addresses common misconceptions about submission and argues that it is not demeaning or oppressive when properly understood and applied.\nThroughout the seminar, Street emphasizes the importance of wives respecting and honoring their husbands, while also encouraging wives to use their intellect and abilities to complement their husbands. He presents a view of marriage where the husband is the leader, but the wife plays a crucial role as a “suitable helper” and influential partner."

He contrasts worldly notions of leadership and love with biblical concepts, emphasizing servant leadership and sacrificial love modeled after Christ’s relationship with the church.\nThe seminar presents a complementarian approach to marriage, where husbands and wives have distinct roles, but the husband’s leadership is characterized by servanthood rather than domination. Street consistently emphasizes the husband’s responsibility to initiate love, understanding, and spiritual growth in the marriage."

    "text": "John Street’s Marriage Seminar Analysis\n\nMain Points\n\n00:42:52 To be a godly husband, you need to be a learner of your wife, studying her and knowing her better than anyone else.\n00:50:55 Husbands are called to be Christ-like lovers, loving their wives as sacrificially as Christ loved the church.\n00:55:23 Husbands should be leaders in the marriage and home, providing humble, servant-hearted leadership.\n\n\n\nArguments\n\n00:24:40 God’s curse after the Fall introduced conflict in marriage, with the wife desiring to control her husband and the husband ruling over his wife. This is not God’s original intent.\n00:38:35 The world’s view of leadership is about exercising top-down authority, but Jesus modeled servant leadership which should be applied in marriage.\n00:50:28 The Bible assumes husbands already love themselves a lot. They need to love their wives more than their natural tendency toward self-love.\n\n\n\nBible Verses\n\n00:11:52 Genesis 3:16 - Describes the curse on the woman, that her desire will be for her husband and he will rule over her.\n00:38:13 Matthew 20:25-28 - Jesus teaches that worldly leadership is about lording authority over others, but whoever wants to be great must be a servant.\n00:53:07 Ephesians 5:23-25 - Instructs husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the church, and to be the head of the wife as Christ is head of the church.\n\n\n\nPractical Applications\n\n00:44:27 Husbands should give focused attention to their wives, treating her as a precious gift to be cherished and honored.\n00:55:50 Godly leadership is not about making all the decisions but valuing the wife’s input and perspective. Husbands should lead by example, not force.\n01:01:03 Husbands should aim to be a joy for their wives and families to be around, not bringing stress from work into the home.\n\n\n\nOverview\nThe central message of John Street’s seminar is that husbands are called to humble, Christ-like leadership and love in their marriages. He argues that sin has distorted the marriage relationship, but husbands can live out God’s intent by prioritizing knowing their wives, sacrificially loving them, and providing servant leadership in the home.\nStreet supports his main points with biblical arguments, drawing from Genesis, Jesus’ teachings, and Paul’s household instructions. He emphasizes that the world’s self-centered view of leadership and love is contrary to the other-oriented, sacrificial mindset Christian husbands should cultivate.\nThroughout the seminar, Street provides practical advice for husbands to implement these principles. Key applications include intentionally learning about one’s wife, cherishing her as a precious gift, humbly leading by example, and bringing joy into the home.\nRecurring themes include the impact of the Fall on marriage, contrasting worldly and biblical mindsets, and specific ways husbands can sacrificially love and lead like Christ. Street’s overall approach emphasizes the husband’s weighty responsibility to shape the marriage according to God’s Word and the power of living out these truths.\nThe transcript appears to cover the seminar content clearly, without major ambiguities. Street’s points are well-developed and supported by scripture and practical illustrations."

    "text": "sywx was the first to define the job title “AI Engineer” as a role in between a Data Scientist and Full Stack Software Engineer, someone that builds on top of large foundation models and can quickly build services using these models. I agree with him that this job function will likely expand whether you hold the job title of “AI Engineer” or not.\nI had the privilege of attending the inaugural AI Engineer Summit in San Francisco, CA held on October 9-10, 2023. It was somewhat surprising being one of the few data scientists at the conference as most people I met were software engineers trying to transition into AI Engineering.\nThe talks were livestreamed (Day 1 and Day 2). Below are my notes from the conference.\n\n\nSimon Suo, Cofounder / CTO, LlamaIndex\n\n\nVery indepth workshop on how to build an end to end RAG app over Ray documentation, also using Ray to build it. Slides are in the repo below.\nhttps://github.com/Disiok/ai-engineer-workshop\nHallucinations: Most of the time it is caused by irrelevant retrieved passages\nEvaluation: can think of both end-to-end evaluation and component-wise evaluation of a RAG app\n\nEnd-to-end: understand how well the full RAG application works\nComponent-wise: understand specific components like the retriever (are we retrieving the relevant context?) and the generation (given the context, are we generating an accurate and coherent answer?)\n\nData Required\n\nUser Query: representative set of real user queries\nUser Feedback: feedback from past interaction, up/down vote\nGolden Context: set of relevant documents from our corpus to best answer a given query\nGolden Answer: best ansewr given golden context\n\n\n\n\n\nHarrison Chase, CEO, LangChain\n\n\nhttps://github.com/hwchase17/ai-engineer\nOpenAI function calling within LangChain to do structured data extraction, build agents to do extraction and tagging and use tools. Also a quick tutorial on\nLangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a relatively new way (introduced in Aug 2023) to compose langchain components\n\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"Tell me a short joke about {topic}\"\n)\nmodel = ChatOpenAI()\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\n\n# define the chain\nchain = prompt | model | output_parser\n\n# don't .run() the chain but call .invoke()\nchain.invoke({\"topic\": \"bears\"})\n\nOpenAI’s Function Calling is a way to get OpenAI’s language models to return structured data (arguments to run a function or extract structured data from text). This is a powerful feature!\nI’m surprised other LLM providers have not yet introduced this functionality.\nlangchain exposes helper function to make working with function calling easier\n\nfrom langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function\n\nclass WeatherSearch(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Call this with an airport code to get the weather at that airport\"\"\"\n    airport_code: str = Field(description=\"airport code to get weather for\")\n\nweather_function = convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(WeatherSearch)\nweather_function\n\n# {'name': 'WeatherSearch',\n#  'description': 'Call this with an airport code to get the weather at that airport',\n#  'parameters': {'title': 'WeatherSearch',\n#   'description': 'Call this with an airport code to get the weather at that airport',\n#   'type': 'object',\n#   'properties': {'airport_code': {'title': 'Airport Code',\n#     'description': 'airport code to get weather for',\n#     'type': 'string'}},\n#   'required': ['airport_code']}}\nthen you can pass the weather function to the LLM\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nmodel = ChatOpenAI()\nmodel.invoke(\"What is the weather in San Francisco right now?\",\n             functions=[weather_function])  \nYou can also bind the function to the model:\nmodel_with_function = model.bind(functions=[weather_function])\nYou can force OpenAI to use a function, but you can only pass one function here.\nmodel_forced_function = model.bind(functions=[weather_function], function_call={\"name\":\"WeatherSearch\"})\nFunction calling is a great way to do structured data extraction from text for example extracting name, age tuples.\nfrom typing import Optional\nclass Person(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Information about a person.\"\"\"\n    name: str = Field(description=\"person's name\")\n    age: Optional[int] = Field(description=\"person's age\")\n  \nclass Information(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Information to extract.\"\"\"\n    people: List[Person] = Field(description=\"List of info about people\")\n\nextraction_functions = [convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Information)]\nextraction_model = model.bind(functions=extraction_functions, function_call={\"name\":\"Information\"})\nextraction_model.invoke(\"Joe is 30.

A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.A prompt for a text-to-text model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat\\'s little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem about leaves falling\", a short statement of feedback (for example, \"too verbose\", \"too formal\", \"rephrase again\", \"omit this word\") or a longer statement including context, instructions, and input data. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as \"maison -&gt; house, chat -&gt; cat, chien -&gt;\", an approach called few-shot learning.When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\". Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.\\n\\nPage: Sentence embedding\\nSummary: In natural language processing, a sentence embedding refers to a numeric representation of a sentence in the form of a vector of real numbers which encodes meaningful semantic information.State of the art embeddings are based on the learned hidden layer representation of dedicated sentence transformer models. BERT pioneered an approach involving the use of a dedicated [CLS] token preprended to the beginning of each sentence inputted into the model; the final hidden state vector of this token encodes information about the sentence and can be fine-tuned for use in sentence classification tasks. In practice however, BERT\\'s sentence embedding with the [CLS] token achieves poor performance, often worse than simply averaging non-contextual word embeddings. SBERT later achieved superior sentence embedding performance by fine tuning BERT\\'s [CLS] token embeddings through the usage of a siamese neural network architecture on the SNLI dataset. \\nOther approaches are loosely based on the idea of distributional semantics applied to sentences. Skip-Thought trains an encoder-decoder structure for the task of neighboring sentences predictions. Though this has been shown to achieve worse performance than approaches such as InferSent or SBERT. \\nAn alternative direction is to aggregate word embeddings, such as those returned by Word2vec, into sentence embeddings. The most straightforward approach is to simply compute the average of word vectors, known as continuous bag-of-words (CBOW). However, more elaborate solutions based on word vector quantization have also been proposed. One such approach is the vector of locally aggregated word embeddings (VLAWE), which demonstrated performance improvements in downstream text classification tasks.'\nYou can also create a conversational agent that can use tools using the AgentExecutor class. I believe the AgentExecutor handles the message types and routing for you.\nfrom langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentExecutor\n\nagent_chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(\n    agent_scratchpad= lambda x: format_to_openai_functions(x[\"intermediate_steps\"])\n) | chain\n\nagent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent_chain, tools=tools, verbose=True)\n\nagent_executor.invoke({\"input\": \"what is langchain?\"})\n\n# &gt; Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n\n# Invoking: `search_wikipedia` with `{'query': 'langchain'}`\n\n\n# Page: LangChain\n# Summary: LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs).

Though this has been shown to achieve worse performance than approaches such as InferSent or SBERT. \n# An alternative direction is to aggregate word embeddings, such as those returned by Word2vec, into sentence embeddings. The most straightforward approach is to simply compute the average of word vectors, known as continuous bag-of-words (CBOW). However, more elaborate solutions based on word vector quantization have also been proposed. One such approach is the vector of locally aggregated word embeddings (VLAWE), which demonstrated performance improvements in downstream text classification tasks.\n\n\n\n# Page: Prompt engineering\n# Summary: Prompt engineering, primarily used in communication with a text-to-text model and text-to-image model, is the process of structuring text that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. Prompt engineering is enabled by in-context learning, defined as a model's ability to temporarily learn from prompts. The ability for in-context learning is an emergent ability of large language models.\n# A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform. A prompt for a text-to-text model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat's little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem about leaves falling\", a short statement of feedback (for example, \"too verbose\", \"too formal\", \"rephrase again\", \"omit this word\") or a longer statement including context, instructions, and input data. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". Prompt engineering may consist of a single prompt that includes a few examples for a model to learn from, such as \"maison -&gt; house, chat -&gt; cat, chien -&gt;\", an approach called few-shot learning.When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\". Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.\n\n# LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It is a language model integration framework that can be used for various purposes such as document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis. LangChain allows developers to leverage the power of language models in their applications.\n\n# &gt; Finished chain.\nYou can also add memory to the Agent:\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentExecutor\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n    (\"system\", \"You are helpful but sassy assistant\"),\n    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"chat_history\"),\n    (\"user\", \"{input}\"),\n    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"agent_scratchpad\")\n])\n\nchain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(\n    agent_scratchpad= lambda x: format_to_openai_functions(x[\"intermediate_steps\"])\n) | prompt | model | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser()\n\n# what happens when conversation buffer memory gets too long?\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True,memory_key=\"chat_history\")\n\nagent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=chain, tools=tools, verbose=True, memory=memory)\n\nquery = \"What is the weather in san francisco right now?\"\nagent_executor.invoke({\"input\":query})\n\n\n\nswyx, Latent.Space & Smol.ai Born too late to explore the earth.

A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.A prompt for a text-to-text model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat\\'s little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem about leaves falling\", a short statement of feedback (for example, \"too verbose\", \"too formal\", \"rephrase again\", \"omit this word\") or a longer statement including context, instructions, and input data. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as \"maison -&gt; house, chat -&gt; cat, chien -&gt;\", an approach called few-shot learning.When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\".

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nJohn Street’s marriage seminar focuses on the importance of godly communication in Christian marriages. The central message emphasizes that good communication doesn’t happen automatically, even in Christian relationships, and that every marriage faces challenges due to the sinful nature of humans. Street argues against the popular notion of compatibility, asserting that conflicts arise not from personality differences but from internal desires and passions.\nThe seminar is structured around four main rules of communication derived from Ephesians 4: be honest, keep current, attack the problem (not the person), and act (don’t react). Street uses various Bible verses to support these points, particularly drawing from Ephesians and James. He emphasizes the need for Christians to not only stop negative communication patterns but also actively practice positive ones.\nStreet’s approach to marriage is deeply rooted in biblical principles, focusing on personal responsibility, forgiveness, and the pursuit of godliness in marital relationships. He stresses the importance of understanding the root causes of conflicts and addressing them promptly and lovingly. The seminar provides practical applications for implementing these communication rules in daily life, encouraging couples to be intentional about changing their habits to align with biblical teachings.\nThroughout the seminar, there is a recurring theme of the transformative power of applying biblical principles to marriage. Street consistently emphasizes the need for deliberate effort in changing communication patterns and the importance of viewing one’s spouse through the lens of grace and forgiveness. His teaching style combines theological explanation with practical examples, making the content accessible and applicable to his audience."
