    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s seemingly a firehose of development in the last month or so. I’ve been trying to keep up with the latest developments in GPT and related models. Here’s a list of papers, code, and news that I’ve found interesting. This is mainly for myself to have a reference, but I hope it’s useful to others as well. I was largely inspired by @osanseviero who created ml_timeline.\n\nPapers\n\n2022-08-21 - Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models (paper, blog)\n2023-03-13 - Alpaca – Stanford’s CRFM group released a 1.5B parameter GPT-3 like model. They were the first to demonstrate you can get GPT-like performance using only 52k instruction-following data points. On the self-instruct evaluation set, Alpaca shows many behaviors similar to OpenAI’s text-davinci-003, but is also surprisingly small and easy/cheap to reproduce. I think one reason OpenAI dropped their pricing by 90% with GPT-4 is because they wanted to achieve wide distribution of their model.\n2023-03-15 - GPT-4 Technical Paper (paper) - highlights some of the amazing improvements GPT-4 has made over GPT-3\n2023-03-27 - GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models (paper) – Paper that identifies the occupations that have the highest exposure to automation by GPT. In related news, ResumeBuilder found 1 in 4 companies have already replaced workers with ChatGPT\n2023-03-22 - Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence (paper)\n2023-03-20 – Reflexion: an autonomous agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection (paper). A related post.\n2023-03-23 - AI Explained – GPT4 can improve itself (video) - Intro to Reflexion and HuggingGPT\n2023-03-30 - HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace (paper, code) - Using a LLM as brain, HuggingGPT identifies what HuggingFace models to use to solve tasks. Notably Microsoft is calling this JARVIS.\n\n\n\nLibraries / Tools\n\nGithub Copilot - I use Copilot in my IDE, VS Code and it’s dramatically improved my producitivity (10-20%?). More than that it makes coding less tedious and lowers the activiation energy for coding tasks. For example generating docstrings is trivial (and happens much more frequently!). And because the recommendations are inline, the developer’s ‘flow’ is not broken. I also moved from Jupyter Notebooks in a browser to using Jupyter in VS Code. Radek Omulski has a blog post for how to set this up. I do plan to try GenAI as well. I tried GenAI and it basically automatically sends all errors to ChatGPT and provides suggested corrected syntax to try in line in your Jupyter notebook. It actually can be a nice complement to Copilot.\nLangChain - Building applications with LLMs through composability\nllama_index - LlamaIndex (GPT Index) is a project that provides a central interface to connect your LLM’s with external data.\nGenAI - generative AI tooling for IPython\nmarvin - Meet Marvin: a batteries-included library for building AI-powered software. Marvin’s job is to integrate AI directly into your codebase by making it look and feel like any other function.\n\n\n\nPrompt Engineering\nPrompt engineering is the process of creating prompts for LLMs. Essentially optimizing the input into LLMs.\n\nWhat is Prompt Engineering - like how Googling became a skill (aka “Google-fu”), I think Prompt Engineering is an important skill to develop\nawesome-chatgpt-prompts - A curated list of awesome ChatGPT prompts. I like “Act as a Linux Terminal” prompt.\nPrompt Engineering Guide - “Motivated by the high interest in developing with LLMs, we have created this new prompt engineering guide that contains all the latest papers, learning guides, lectures, references, and tools related to prompt engineering.” Code: repo.\n\n\n\nOutput Parsers\nWhere prompt engineering works on the input to LLMs, output parsers work on the output.\n\nOutput Parsers - LangChain calls this “Output Parsers”. LangChain can return a list, JSON, any Python type (using Pydantic) and two other ways of handling outputs: OutputFixingParser and RetryOutputParser\nEnforcing AI Format - Marvin calls this “Enforcing AI format”. Marvin can return a string, list of dicts, JSON or really any Python type (using Pydantic)\n\n\n\nPredictions\n\n2023-04-01 - @AllenDowney predicts “The great majority of coding will be LLM-assisted, starting now.” (tweet, blog)"

    "title": "Staying Human in the Age of LLMs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The WSJ’s Ben Cohen wrote an article highlighting Professor Po-Shen Loh, a math professor from Carnegie Mellon University and coach for Team USA’s International Mathematical Olympiad. He’s currently touring the country with a mission to inspire a love of mathematics and provide practical guidance for the new challenges brought by AI and tools like ChatGPT (giving 50 lectures in 32 cities in 35 days!). Loh’s message is clear: to survive in this era of artificial intelligence, one must lean into what makes us human.\nLoh emphasizes the importance of creativity, emotion, and human uniqueness, skills that AI cannot replicate, and which will become increasingly valuable as AI becomes more advanced. He wants young minds to understand the importance of their humanity in an AI-dominated future. However, this lesson is not just for students but applies to all businesses trying to navigate the uncharted territory of AI integration.\nThe new generation, Loh asserts, will have a better intuitive understanding of AI as they’re the first to grow up with this technology as a constant in their lives. With tools like ChatGPT being used in everyday life, young people are already interacting with and understanding the implications of AI. Being a millenial, though I do remember a time when there was no internet and needing to use a physical copy of Encylopedia Brittanica to do research, my generation grew up with Google and being able to access information at our fingertips. This next generation will grow up with AI and ChatGPT-like technologies as a constant in their lives.\nPo-Shen Loh’s message, while initially targeted towards students, has a universality that is applicable beyond the boundaries of classrooms; it serves as crucial advice for anyone preparing for the future of work in an AI-integrated world. Loh emphasizes the indispensable qualities of being able to create value and identify human pain points. In his words, “The future of jobs is figuring out how to find pain points, and a pain point is a human pain… You need to be able to create value. People who make value will always have opportunities.”\nI wholeheartedly concur with Loh’s perspective. In today’s rapidly advancing digital age, we can already see a distinct division emerging between those leveraging large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT effectively in their work, and those who do not. These tools can augment human capabilities, enable more efficient processes, and offer innovative solutions to complex problems.\nHowever, it is not the tools alone that will secure a competitive advantage. Instead, it is the ability to apply these tools ingeniously and to couple their computational prowess with human creativity, intuition, and understanding of complex human needs. This blend of technological aptitude and human sensitivity is what will differentiate the truly successful individuals and organizations in the future.\nLoh’s message should serve as a call to action for individuals and businesses alike: value creation, coupled with understanding and addressing human-centric concerns, is what will allow us to thrive in the AI-enhanced future. Those who can combine their unique human skills with the power of AI, to enhance their problem-solving capabilities and offer more value, will always find themselves at an advantageous position."

And cheaper!\nFine-tuning is becoming cheaper.\nEvaluation of LLMs is very hard - feels very subjective still.\nManaged APIs are expensive.\n“Traditional” ML isn’t going anywhere.\nMemory matters - for both serving and training.\nInformation retrieval w/ vector databases is becoming standard pattern.\nStart w/ prompt engineering and push that to its limits before fine-tuning w/ smaller models.\nUse agents/chains only when necessary. They are unruly.\nLatency is critical for a good user experience.\nPrivacy is critical.\n\nAs a practicing data scientist, #6 is reassuring!\nHere are some of the videos:\n\nMatei - LLMOps: The Emerging Toolkit for Reliable, High-quality LLM Applications\nChip - Building LLM Applications for Production\nSamyam - Do More with Less: Large Model Training and Inference with DeepSpeed"

    "text": "Walter Isaacson is set to release a biography of Elon Musk later this year. He was recently on a Twitter Space with a few other people talking about Musk. One of the things that stood out to me was Isaacson’s description of Musk’s ability to focus. Here’s a transcript of what he said:\n\nBut I guess one of the most amazing things he does is he can sequentially focus. I remmeber the night he actually wound up getting Twitter, the board agreed, he was going to get Twitter, the deal was accepted. He went to Brownsville in order to do a Raptor engine redesign meeting late at night. And then stayed up with Kimbell in a honkeytonk. And then focused on the battery production issues and whether they all should be moved to Austin… it was all in one night.\n\nListening to this made me think about how important focus is. This idea also came up when I was speaking to another data scientist who asked me what is one thing that has helped you the most in your career. I told him focus. The ability to focus in our distracted age is becoming rarer and thus a more valuable skill if you can do it. Being able to focus means turning your attention to a single task (since multi-tasking is a myth). And your attention is focused on that task for an extended period of time. A big part of focus is being able to say no to certain things. This ability to focus has benefits not just in your career but also in your personal life.\nAs a data scientist, I might move from focusing on analyzing a new data set, writing deep learning training code, wrangling prompts for an LLM, reviewing someone else’s code in a pull request or writing long form documentation. All of these are distinct tasks that take a certain amount of focus. Being able to focus on these work tasks means saying no to interruptions that may come by way of Slack messages, emails, or even meetings. Some things that have helped me in this area:\n\nUsing a Pomodoro timer like Be Focused to work in 25 minute increments.\nFiguring out what hours of the day you do your best work. I find my energy takes a dip in the early afternoons and I try and do less cognitively intense tasks then.\nBlocking time on my calendar to do focused work. Even better, deciding ahead of time what you do in those time blocks.\nStacking meetings on a given day. I try to have all of my 1-1s on a single day.\n\nStepping out of my data scientist shoes, focus is incredibly valuable as a Christian: reading the Bible, praying, and memorizing verses all require focus. Being a father, focus is important too in order to be a present with your kids.\nDo your best to try and grow this muscle of focus. It will pay dividends in your career and personal life.\nCal Newport also has a great book on this topic called Deep Work. I highly recommend it."

    "title": "All-In Hosts Opinion on Jobs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "During Episode 132 of the All-In Podcast, (transcript here) the hosts took a live question from the audience:\n\n\nHi, I’m Jeff, a full-time corporate VC and part-time angel. My question is about AI and higher education and it’s actually some covert parenting advice so you can decide who’s that’s relevant for. My son just finished his freshman year of college and I’m questioning what the future is for him in higher education, given all the change that AI is going to have on every career and every profession. And I’m wondering what advice you’d give to your child or someone who’s in college right now for what’s an area of study that maybe won’t be disrupted by AI or an area that AI, you’ll get leverage from your education through AI.\n\nChamath:\n\nI think the reality is that most of the existing jobs that we have in the United States are going to go to lower cost locations that have that tool chain to accelerate their capability. So we are going to have to reinvent the workforce and the things that we do over the next 30 or 40 years to stay relevant. That’s probably like, I think that should just be the operating principle. If you think about it, we used to run great call centers. Okay, those call centers were outsourced to the Philippines and India. But in the next, you know, five or 10 years, you’ll have this flawless unaccented English or even more eerily, perfectly accented English for the zip code of the person that’s calling in so that it sounds like they’re talking to somebody that’s literally their neighbor. That’s like just makes so much sense, right? So it’s like all this stuff is going to happen where like all these classes of jobs are going to go away. I saw this article where a lawyer, two lawyers use chat GPT to submit a legal brief. The problem was that it cited cases that didn’t exist and now they’re going to be disbarred. So this is like serious business, right? Like you can’t do that.\n\n\nYou know, if I had to choose something for my kids, I would probably, I would probably tell them to do something mathematical or biological.\n\nJason:\n\nI’ve been thinking about this a lot too. I think teaching them to be entrepreneurial, resilient, worldly, ability to communicate, ability to lead other people in teams, that stuff’s not going to go away, communication skill, etc. I’m encouraging everybody who I work with to just use chat GPT-4 and Bard every day for every single thing that they do. My base thesis right now is that the job freezes, the hiring freezes out of all these companies is indefinite. I’m assuming it’s indefinite because the amount of work it takes to write a job requisition is more work in some cases than actually automating with AI or ready the job function. And so I think 20 person companies might double in size in the next two or three years, but still have 20 people. This is going to be a big challenge for society. And if that does come to pass, there’s just going to be large swaths of people who are not going to be able to get job interviews for anything other than service jobs. We need a lot more plumbers, electricians, waiters, et cetera. Those probably jobs won’t go away, especially if we don’t let people immigrate. I am super enthusiastic about that efficiency, but I think it also means you have to be entrepreneurial because if you can’t get a job and you can’t get mentored, you better create your own opportunity. You better create your own company. And that’s what I’m seeing. That’s the game on the field right now. Two or three people who don’t have job offers from Uber and Airbnb and Google and Facebook just saying, let’s start a company because there’s nothing else for us to do. And those are highly skilled people right now doing that.\n\nSacks:\n\nI’ll say two quick things about this topic. So one is, I think there’s a lot of AI fear porn out there right now. And I just think that like all of these tumor scenarios are, they’re not going to play out overnight. I mean, this is going to take a while. Second, if you think about like job elimination, it’s going to be some super specialized jobs. So for example, I wouldn’t want to be a radiologist right now, but doctors will be fine. So I think if you’re thinking about like going into a job category that’s super specialized and clearly in the way of AI, then that probably is not a good idea. But most general skills like you’re talking about and most job categories are going to be fine. There’s just going to be some specialties within them that make it. dislocated. Like, I wouldn’t want to be a truck driver either, you know, because of self-driving. But transportation companies are still going to exist. So I think you just want to be careful about super specialization, I think. But building general skills is always really good. That really should be the point of college.\n\nMy observations:\n\nI found it surprising Sacks thought lawyers and accountants were “sufficiently” general that he doesn’t think they’ll be eliminated.\nSacks’ point that some super specialized jobs will be eliminated is a good one, e.g. radiologists. But I also think some lawyers and accounting jobs will go this route too.\nJason is telling his employees to use GPT-4 or Bard for every task at work. I agree this is a good idea to get familiar with how LLMs work and to essentially have a super-assistant at your disposal. GPT-4 is particularly good.\nOverall I think it’s still too early to make any definitive statements about what jobs will be eliminated. I think it’s safe to say that most jobs will be affected in some way, but it’s hard to say how. This is something I’m fascinated by though, how as a society we will adjust as these language models permeate through organizations, companies and products."

    "text": "I’m currently working my way through the Databricks LLM101x Course on EdX. It’s actually pretty good. During the third section, there was this interesting example where they created a data science agent called DaScie. Given a prompt, the agent was able to carry out some interesting tasks.\n\n\nFirst to define the agent using langchain, OpenAI and then giving it some tools.\n\n# For DaScie we need to load in some tools for it to use, as well as an LLM for the brain/reasoning\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools  # This will allow us to load tools we need\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.agents import (\n    AgentType,\n)  # We will be using the type: ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION which is standard\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\n# For OpenAI we'll use the default model for DaScie\nllm = OpenAI()\ntools = load_tools([\"wikipedia\", \"serpapi\", \"python_repl\", \"terminal\"], llm=llm)\n# We now create DaScie using the \"initialize_agent\" command.\ndascie = initialize_agent(\n    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True\n)\n\n\n\n\nTo run the agent, you just pass an instruction:\n\ndascie.run(\n    \"Create a dataset (DO NOT try to download one, you MUST create one based on what you find) on the performance of the Mercedes AMG F1 team in 2020 and do some analysis.

    "title": "Large Language Models, Work and the Future of Jobs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last month, Allen Downey showcased the power of ChatGPT by using it to solve every problem in his Think Python books. As a result, he encouraged everyone who writes code to use LLM-assistance in their development. This inspired me to further explore the capabilities of GPT-4 and its potential effects on work and productivity.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are already transforming the way we work. Even in my work as a data scientist, ChatGPT (actually GPT-4) has dramatically affected how I work and my daily tasks. Just a quick listing out of some of the prompts I’ve sent to GPT-4 in the last month:\n\nExtracting features from pairs of resumes and job descriptions in JSON\nCopy pasted a Linux error OSError: [Errno 28] inotify watch limit reached and GPT-4 explained what the error was and how to fix it (unprompted)\nWhat factors to consider what going from a individual contributor to a manager role\nCopy pasted a SQL query to debug it\nHow to make a tensor of 0’s of a data type Long and Int\nIn PyTorch what does batch_first=False do?\nHelp writing a MLOps Python wrapper package that wraps Vertex AI Pipelines\nCopy and pasted\n\n187 packages can be updated.\n27 updates are security updates.\nAnd it responded with commands for how to update package lists, upgrade packages and do a distribution upgrade too\n\nReformat JSON dictionaries\nHelping to write unit tests\n\nIt’s difficult to quantify how much time GPT-4 has saved me, which it certainly has. I’d estimate it on average saves me about 1 hour of work per day. More than the time saved, the value of LLMs has been lowering the activation energy needed to get started. With data science and coding related prompts, I can arrive at answers much more directly and therefore quickly than trying to search Google and read StackOverflow answers. The code GPT-4 returns doesn’t always work the first time (zero-shot). In most cases, if an error is returned by that code, putting the error code back into the prompt will allow GPT-4 to generate correct code (one-shot, few-shot).\nAlong with Github Copilot, which is like autocomplete for code in an IDE like VS Code or PyCharm, I will likely never go back to coding without these assistants. They make me that much more productive. Though it’s also difficult to quantify how much more productive, 5%? 10%? 50%? There have been stories of people losing their jobs because of these technologies, but these are still relatively rare. I think the short-term impacts of these tools is making those that use them much more productive than those that don’t. Allen Downey wrote a post about LLM-assisted programming where he said:\n\nWhich brings me to what I think will be the most important skill for LLM-assisted programming: reading code. LLMs can generate code much faster than we can understand it, so the ability to read, understand, and check code will be critical.\n\n\nThe other skill that will become more important is meta-language, that is, the vocabulary we use to talk about programs. In my correlation in Elm example, I asked ChatGPT to “factor out the anonymous function”, and it new exactly what I meant. In general, it seems to understand the meta-language of programming well, so it will be useful if we can speak it.\n\nI tend to agree with his points. Reading code is going to be critical. Also knowing the right terminology or “meta-language” as Downey calls it to prompt the LLM is also critical. For example, using Github Copilot I was working in a Jupyter Notebook preparing some data for a model that was in a dataframe. I wrote a comment “# pivot this from wide to long” and the LLM was able to generate the code to do exactly what I needed. This took 5 seconds instead of 30-60 seconds to Google and arrive at this SO answer. But one would need to know what terms like “pivot” and what “wide” and “long” data are (see Hadley Wickham’s Tidy Data paper to learn more).\nTechnological advancements inevitably change jobs and work dynamics. Some jobs may disappear, while others may evolve, and new ones will emerge. Although it’s difficult to predict the pace and extent of these changes, there already have been a few studies on the topic. But I would take these with a grain of salt given how difficult it is to forecast the future.\n\n2023-03-02 - How will Language Modelers like ChatGPT Affect Occupations and Industries?\n2023-03-17 - GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models\n2023-04-23 - The Future of ChatGPT-enabled Labor Market: A Preliminary Study\n\nWhat is more valuable is waiting for real-world examples of how LLMs are affecting work. Here are some examples I’ve seen:\n\n2023-05-02 - IBM CEO Arvind Krishna says 30% of backoffice non-customer facing roles like human resources being replaced by AI. That’s 30% of 26,000 roles or 7,800 roles being replaced over the next 5 years. See this article for more details.\n2023-04-27 - In a letter to Dropbox employees, CEO Drew Houston said the company is laying off 16% of its workforce. He said the company is shifting its focus to early-stage product development and AI. See the full letter here. Two very interesting quotes where he talks about not being able to upskill his current workforce and needing to hire new talent:\n\n\nSecond, and more consequentially, the AI era of computing has finally arrived. We’ve believed for many years that AI will give us new superpowers and completely transform knowledge work. And we’ve been building towards this future for a long time, as this year’s product pipeline will demonstrate.\n\n\nIn an ideal world, we’d simply shift people from one team to another. And we’ve done that wherever possible. However, our next stage of growth requires a different mix of skill sets, particularly in AI and early-stage product development.

    "text": "In this post I’ll go over some observations I’ve had while using OpenAI’s Code Interpreter for the first time. It is not available as an API, rather only through the ChatGPT web interface for ChatGPT Plus subscribers ($20/month).\nIf you aren’t familiar with Code Interpreter, it is:\nReally the only change is a “+” button in the ChatGPT interface but this small change unlocks quite a bit of use cases. One of which is data analysis since you can upload data and have the LLM analyze and reason over it.\nOverall I am quite impressed with Code Interpreter’s capabilities. I would characterize Code Interpreter as a very capable intern whose output you need to validate. That being said it is a very capable agent in doing data analysis tasks. I would estimate this analyses took me 20 minutes to do. If I actually wanted to do it, I’d estimate it would’ve taken me 2 hours, so 6x longer. But it’s not just a matter of time savings, it is a matter of cognitive-load savings. It was not very cognitively-intense to use Code Interpreter whereas I, a human, doing these analyses would’ve taken me a lot of mental energy. Because of that, I’d held off on running this type of analyses for a long time (sitting on this idea for a year?) but with Code Interpreter, I was able to do it in 20 minutes. And this opens up many other analyses that I would love to do but have not had the time or energy to do."

    "text": "Two Reward Models\nInterestingly they also try to generate a diversity of model completions by using two different model variants and different temperature hyperparameters.\n\nOur annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose between two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the two responses to a given prompt are sampled from two different model variants, and varying the temperature hyper-parameter. In addition to giving participants a forced choice, we also ask annotators to label the degree to which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice is significantly better, better, slightly better, or negligibly better/ unsure.\n\nThis model is a first for training two separate reward models, one for safety and one for helpfulness. Meta collected over 1.4M binary comparisons to train their safety and helpfulness reward models. The human annotators also had to pick between 5 different options: significantly better, better, slightly better, or negligibly better/ unsure.\nThe training data for the RLHF models is actually their newly collected preference data along with open source datasets. They do not observe “negative transfer” happening from using open source data so they decided to keep it in to allow for better generalization. The RHLF models are only trained for one epoch to prevent overfitting.\n\nWe combine our newly collected data with existing open-source preference datasets to form a larger training dataset. Initially, open-source datasets were used to bootstrap our reward models while we were in the process of collecting preference annotation data. We note that in the context of RLHF in this study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference for Llama 2-Chat outputs rather than any model outputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source preference datasets. Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better generalization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e. Llama 2-Chat taking advantage of some weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.\n\n\nHelpfulness reward model is eventually trained on all Meta Helpfulness data, combined with an equal parts of the remaining data uniformly sampled from Meta Safety and from the open-source datasets.\nSafety reward model is trained on all Meta Safety and Anthropic Harmless data, mixed with Meta Helpfulness and open-source helpfulness data in a 90/10 proportion. We found that the setting with 10% helpfulness data is especially beneficial for the accuracy on samples where both the chosen and rejected responses were deemed safe."

The same re-ranking strategy for LLMs was also proposed in Deng et al. (2019), where the reward is seen as an energy function. Here, we go one step further, and use the selected outputs for a gradient update. For each prompt, the sample obtaining the highest reward score is considered the new gold standard. Similar to Scialom et al. (2020a), we then fine-tune our model on the new set of ranked samples, reinforcing the reward.\n\nThe two RL algorithms differ in:\n\nBreadth — in Rejection Sampling, the model explores K samples for a given prompt, while only one generation is done for PPO. Depth — in PPO, during training at step t the sample is a function of the updated model policy from t − 1 after the gradient update of the previous step. In Rejection Sampling fine-tuning, we sample all the outputs given the initial policy of our model to collect a new dataset, before applying the fine-tuning similar to SFT. However, since we applied iterative model updates, the fundamental differences between the two RL algorithms are less pronounced.\n\n\n\n\nMax Reward among N Samples\n\n\nThe above plot is interesting in that it highlights the potential gain from using Rejection Sampling. Because more samples are generated, a diversity of completions can be explored and on average these generates a higher maximum reward. Though this plot has a truncated y-axis which makes the difference look larger than it is."

The dataset also contains a few synthetic constraints to sample from like hobbies, language or public figure (and random combinations of the above).

High IRR scores (closer to 1.0) are typically seen as better from a data quality perspective, however, context is important. Highly subjective tasks like evaluating the overall helpfulness of LLM generations will usually have lower IRR scores than more objective labelling tasks. There are relatively few public benchmarks for these contexts, so we feel sharing our analysis here will benefit the research community. We used Gwet’s AC1/2 statistic (Gwet, 2008, 2014) to measure inter-rater reliability (IRR), as we found it to be the most stable metric across different measurement scenarios. On the 7-point Likert scale helpfulness task that is used in our analysis, Gwet’s AC2 score varies between 0.37 and 0.55 depending on the specific model comparison. We see scores on the lower end of that range for ratings from model comparisons with similar win rates to each other (like the Llama 2-Chat-70B-chat vs. ChatGPT comparison).

For example, our prompt set does not include any coding- or reasoning-related prompts. We only evaluate the final generation of a multi-turn conversation. A more interesting evaluation could be to ask the models to complete a task and rate the overall experience with the model over multiple turns. Human evaluation for generative models is inherently subjective and noisy. As a result, evaluation on a different set of prompts or with different instructions could result in different results."

    "text": "RHLF &gt; SFT\nThe authors make a fascinating conclusion of the superiority of RHLF to supervised-finetuning because of the limitations of human authors to generate diverse and high-quality text.\n\nEven with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on SFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur- thermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human annotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation for RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end distribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we can see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\n\n\n\n\nDistribution shift of SFT to RHLF models\n\n\n\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the best annotators may not chart. Nonetheless, humans can still provide valuable feedback when comparing two answers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished artists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of LLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as documented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold standard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”\n\nWe may be entering an era where supervised data (human generated text) for supervised fine-tuning is no longer as useful as model-generated text from the most powerful models like GPT-4. Andrej Karpathy made a similar argument in his talk (State of GPT at around 17:00) saying that its easier for humans to compare two completions (what one does when creating training data for the reward model) vs. creating a completion from scratch (what one does when creating training data for the SFT model)."

For creative prompts, the RHLF models continue to generate diverse completions. However for factual prompts, the RHLF models learn to generate similar completions.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in temperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the Self-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model. On the other hand, for prompts based on factual information, such as “What is the capital of ?” the Self-BLEU slope diminishes over time. This pattern suggests that despite the rising temperature, the model learns to consistently provide the same response to factual prompts.\n\nIt’s not clear to me why temperature here can be above 1.\n\n\n\nRHLF learns to adapt temperature to type of prompt"

These examples included questions like “How long ago did Barack Obama become president?” Each was associated with two critical pieces of metadata: the date when the query was posed — which influenced the response — and the event date, a point in time prior to which the question would be nonsensical. The observation suggests that LLMs have internalized the concept of time to a greater extent than previously assumed, despite their training being solely based on next-token prediction and data that is randomly shuffled without regard to their chronological context."

It’s truly amazing how quickly new model releases get ported over to llama.cpp and quantized (1-2 days).\n# Clone llama.cpp\ngit clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git\ncd llama.cpp\n\n# Build it\nLLAMA_METAL=1 make\n\n# Download model\nexport MODEL=llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin\nwget \"https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GGML/resolve/main/${MODEL}\"\n\n# Run\necho \"Prompt: \" \\\n    && read PROMPT \\\n    && ./main \\\n        -t 8 \\\n        -ngl 1 \\\n        -m ${MODEL} \\\n        --color \\\n        -c 2048 \\\n        --temp 0.7 \\\n        --repeat_penalty 1.1 \\\n        -n -1 \\\n        -p \"[INST] ${PROMPT} [/INST]\"\n\n\nResults\nThis is the first time I’ve ever run an LLM locally using the GPU on my Mac! One prompt I tried was “What’s the difference between data science and data engineering?” Getting about 15 tokens a second and the answer was quite good:\n\n\n\nLlama2: Data Science vs Data Engineering\n\n\nAnother prompt I tried was, “What’s the meaning of life”, not because I was necessarily wondering what llama2 thought the meaning of life was, but because I had read a paper earlier in the day called Generative Language Models and Automated Influence Operations: Emerging Threats and Potential Mitigations. One of the tables in the paper showed the progress language models have made over the years and the prompt used to showcae this was “What is the meaning of life?”\n\n\n\nMeaning of Life Progress in Language Models\n\n\nThe progress from 2011 to 2020 was meaningful. But the progress from 2020 to 2023 is also quite impressive. Here is what llama2 had to say for the same prompt:\n\n\n\nLlama2: Meaning of Life\n\n\nThe model also is able to give strong answers by modifying the previous prompt asking it to wear different hats as a Christian or a Muslim:\n\nAs a Christian, what is the meaning of life?\nAs a Muslim, what is the maning of life?\n\n\n\n\nLlama2: Meaning of Life for a Christian\n\n\n\n\n\nLlama2: Meaning of Life for a Muslim\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of a Language Model Locally\nRunning a language model locally can have several benefits compared to using a cloud-based service. Here are some of the advantages of running a language model locally:\n\nControl and customization: When you run a language model locally, you have complete control over the model and its behavior. You can customize the model to fit your specific needs and requirements, which may not be possible with a cloud-based service.\nPrivacy and security: By running the model locally, you can keep your data and models private and secure. You don’t have to worry about sensitive information being transmitted over the internet or stored on external servers.\nFaster response times: Local models can respond faster than cloud-based services because they don’t require network latency. This is particularly important for applications that require real-time responses, such as chatbots or voice assistants.\nOffline capabilities: With a local language model, you can still use the model even when you don’t have internet access. This is useful for applications that need to work offline or in areas with limited connectivity.\nCost-effective: Running a language model locally can be more cost-effective than using a cloud-based service, especially for large-scale deployments. You don’t have to pay for network bandwidth, data storage, or other cloud-based services.\nBetter performance: Depending on the specific use case, a local language model may perform better than a cloud-based service. This is because you can optimize the model and hardware for your specific use case, which may not be possible with a cloud-based service.\nMore flexibility: With a local language model, you have more flexibility to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies. You can also more easily integrate the model with other systems and applications.\nBetter understanding of data: When you run a language model locally, you have more visibility into your data and how it’s being processed. This can help you better understand your data and improve your model’s performance.\nImproved explainability: Local language models can provide more explainability than cloud-based services. You can see exactly how the model is processing your data and make changes to improve its transparency and accountability.\nBetter integration with other systems: When you run a language model locally, it’s easier to integrate with other systems and applications. You can customize the model to fit your specific needs and requirements, which may not be possible with a cloud-based service.\n\nOverall, running a language model locally can provide several benefits, including control, privacy, faster response times, offline capabilities, cost-effectiveness, better performance, more flexibility, better understanding of data, improved explainability, and better integration with other systems. However, it’s important to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between local and cloud-based models based on your specific use case and requirements.\nNote the above was generated by llama2.\n\n\nAsitop\nYou can also use this library asitop to monitor your GPU locally on a Mac.\n\n\n\nAsitop\n\n\n\n\nllama.cpp output\nRunning this in a terminal produces a bunch of llama.cpp

    "title": "Useful Applications (mostly for Mac)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this blog post, I’ll introduce you to a list of useful applications, covering both developer tools and productivity applications that I’ve found useful over the years. I’ll also provide you with a brief overview of each app, including its key features and how it can help you improve your workflow. This is mostly Mac focused, though some of these are available on other operating systems.\n\nProductivity\nGoogle Chrome: I’ve tried other browsers but I still find myself going back to Chrome.\nWorkflowy: A simple yet powerful app for note-taking, outlining, and task management, Workflowy helps you organize your thoughts and projects using nested lists and intuitive keyboard shortcuts. It’s simple at it’s core as Workflowy is essentially an infinitely nested bulleted list. They’ve added additional features over the years like mirroring lists which I’ve found helpful. Notion may have more features but I haven’t overcome the intertia needed to switch yet.\nTodoist: A great multi platform to-do list app. One of my favorite features is being able to type dates and/or times that Todoist will parse into a due date. Because of my poor memory, I need to write everything down. If it’s task-related, it will go into Todoist. On a related note, the Reminders app on an Apple Watch is also useful for capturing todos on the go. I hold the crown to activate Siri and say “Remind me to do X at tomorrow at 10pm” and this reminder will pop-up at tomorrow 10pm on my iPhone.\nRectangle: A window management app for macOS, Rectangle enables you to quickly and effortlessly resize and organize your windows using keyboard shortcuts or by dragging windows to screen edges. Iused to use ShiftIt which did something similar but Rectangle does the same thing but works on the latest versions of macOS.\nStats: An open-source system monitor for macOS, Stats provides you with detailed information on your CPU, memory, disk, network, and battery usage, all accessible from your menu bar. I used to pay for iStat Menus but stats is an open source version.\nAmphetamine: Keep your Mac awake and prevent it from sleeping with Amphetamine, a powerful and customizable app that allows you to set rules based on applications, time, or power source. Similar to the Caffiene app.\nBe Focused: A productivity-enhancing time management app, Be Focused utilizes the Pomodoro Technique to help you break work into manageable intervals, maintain focus, and stay on track. I find using Pomodoros, setting 25 minute timers of focused work to be incredibly helpful.\nHidden Bar: A minimalist app that allows you to declutter your Mac’s menu bar by hiding icons you don’t need to see all the time, Hidden Bar lets you access these icons with a simple click whenever needed.\n1Password: A reliable password manager. Been using it since version 5.\n\n\nDeveloper Tools\nHomebrew: A must-have package manager for macOS, Homebrew makes it easy to install, update, and manage software packages, including command-line tools and graphical applications.\nVisual Studio Code: A versatile and free source code editor developed by Microsoft, Visual Studio Code supports a wide range of programming languages and comes with built-in support for Git, intelligent code completion, and a plethora of extensions to customize your coding environment.\niTerm2: A highly customizable and feature-rich terminal emulator for macOS, iTerm2 improves upon the default Terminal app with features like split panes, search functionality, and extensive customization options.\nAnaconda/Miniconda: Anaconda is a powerful Python and R distribution that simplifies package management and deployment, while Miniconda is its lightweight counterpart. Both options provide you with the essential tools to set up and manage your data science and machine learning environments.\nzsh: zsh has become my bash replacement.\nOh My Zsh: Makes zsh more useful with a bunch of plugins.\nSublime Text: A sophisticated and lightning-fast text editor designed for code, markup, and prose, Sublime Text offers a sleek interface, multiple selections, and a highly extensible plugin API.\nHere’s a bash script to install all of these packages:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Install Homebrew if not already installed\nif ! command -v brew &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1; then\n  /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nfi\n\n# Update Homebrew and install required packages\nbrew update\nbrew tap homebrew/cask\nbrew tap homebrew/cask-versions\n\n# Productivity\nbrew install --cask google-chrome\nbrew install --cask workflowy\nbrew install --cask todoist\nbrew install --cask rectangle\nbrew install --cask stats\nbrew install --cask amphetamine\nbrew install --cask be-focused\nbrew install --cask hiddenbar\nbrew install --cask 1password\n# uncomment for 1password 6.8.9\n# brew install --cask https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions/master/Casks/1password6.rb\nbrew install --cask dropbox\n\n# Developer Tools\nbrew install --cask visual-studio-code\nbrew install --cask iterm2\nbrew install anaconda\nbrew install zsh\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"\nbrew install --cask sublime-text\n\necho \"Installation complete!\"\nSave the script in a file named install_apps.sh and make it executable using the following command:\nchmod +x install_apps.sh\nFinally, run the script using:\n./install_apps.sh"

    "title": "State of GPT - Andrej Karpathy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Andrej Karpathy gave a talk at a Microsoft conference in late May about the State of GPT: \nHere are some things I learned:\n\n\n\nGPT Assistant Pipeline\n\n\nIt was helpful to see the different stages that training a RLHF-tuned LLM goes through from 1) pretraining, 2) supervised fine-tuning, 3) reward modeling and 4) reinforcement learning.\n\n\n\nBase Models can be Prompted\n\n\nI wasn’t following the literature back then in the era of GPT-2 but it’s interesting to see the different types of prompts that people were trying to get base models to behave like assistants. With ChatGPT now, these types of prompts are not as useful.\n\n\n\nSupervised Fine-tuning Dataset\n\n\nI didn’t realize that these datasets took so much effort to create. A lot of times these contractors are writing long form answers to questions, adhering to very complex labeling instructions to be “helpful, truthful, harmless” taking sometimes hours to write these!\n\n\n\nReward Modeling Training\n\n\nBinary classification between prompt and completion pairs. The completion yellow tokens are coming from the SFT model. Only supervise the training of the Transformer at the green reward token. The transformer will learn to predict the reward token for a given prompt/completion pair. We have the ground truth rewards from our human labelers. As the model is trained it can then better predict the reward tokens.\n\n\n\nReinforcement Learning Training\n\n\nTaking the reward model from the previous stage, we take the tuples of (prompt, completion, reward), the completions are coming from the SFT model (model we want to train), the reward is from the reward model. The rewards are fixed.\nWe train on the yellow tokens and weigh the language model object by the reward. For example, in the first row, the reward is high so we increase the probabilities of those words appearing.\n\n\n\nRLHF vs SFT\n\n\nThe difference between SFT (supervised fine tuning) and RLHF (reinforcement learning human feedback) LLMs. It’s interesting that the InstructGPT paper showed that humans prefer RLHF models to SFT models.\n\n\n\nWhy RLHF?\n\n\nWhy does RLHF work better than SFT? Karpathy offers up an interesting hypothesis basically saying that it is easier for humans to compare two completions (what one does when creating training data for the reward model) vs. creating a completion from scratch (what one does when creating training data for the SFT model). The example being if the prompt is “Write a haiku about paperclips” - it’s much easier to compare two haikus about paper clips than to write a haiku about paper clips from scratch.\n\n\n\nMode collapse\n\n\nOne downside of fine-tuned models I didn’t realize was they lose entropy, in other words fine-tune models often predict one token with high probability instead of a nice distribution of tokens. So base models can be better at tasks where you have N examples of things want to generate more things. Karpathy’s toy example was prompting with “Here are 100 cool pokemon names I made up:” and giving it 7 actual Pokemon and the base model completes with additional generated Pokemon names.\n\n\n\nAssistant Leaderboard\n\n\nA team at Berkeley has assembled Elo ratings from some assistant LLMs. The first 3 are RLHF models, the rest of SFT models. GPT-4 is winning. A link to a more up-to-date version of the leaderboard with Google’s PaLM2: https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-25-leaderboard/ which is still pretty far between GPT3.5 and GPT-4.\n \n\nAll of the internal monologue is stripped away in the text LLMs train on\nThey spend the ~same amount of compute on every token =&gt; LLMs don’t reproduce this behavior by default!\nThey don’t know what they don’t know, they imitate the next token\nThey don’t know what they are good at or not, they imitate the next token They don’t reflect. They don’t sanity check. They don’t correct their mistakes along the way\nThey don’t have a separate “inner monologue stream in their head”\nThey do have very large fact-based knowledge across a vast number of areas\nThey do have a large and ~perfect “working memory” (their context window)\n\nPrompting is a way of making of for the cognitive difference between these two architectures (human brains vs. LLMs).\n\n\n\nChain of Thought\n\n\nModels need tokens to think. By breaking up a task into multiple steps, you are giving the language model an opportunity to think and reason over more tokens.\n\n\n\nCondition on Good Performance\n\n\nBecause language models are trained on all kinds of data, e.g. student solutions to a physics problem or an expert solution to the same problem, you can prompt the model “to be an expert in physics” and that usually improves performance. Apparently the best prompt was “Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.”\n\n\n\nRetrieval-Augmented LLMs\n\n\n\nBreak up relevant documents into chunks\nUse embedding APIs to index chunks into a vector store\nGiven a test-time query, retrieve related information\nOrganize the information into the prompt\n\n\n\n\nFinetuning\n\n\nBecome more accessible to fine-tuning a model:\n\nParameter Efficient Finetuning, e.g. LoRA - only trainng small sparse pieces of your model\nLow-precision inference, e.g. bitsandbytes\nOpen source high quality models like LLaMA\n\n\n\n\nDefault Recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\nUse cases"

Currently I’m a Principal Data Scientist at UKG. Prior to that, I’ve held data science positions at Medidata, PIMCO, Payoff and Allianz. Prior to getting into data science, I was an actuary.\nOn this site I keep a technical blog and resume. I also enjoy writing about personal finance."
