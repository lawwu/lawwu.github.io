At Google Cloud Next 2024, Elad Gil interviewed Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic. I recorded the talk (really bad audio) and transcribed it using a whisper (small-en) model. I passed the transcription to Claude 3 (Haiku), Gemini Pro 1.5 and GPT-4 to summarize it with this prompt:

> This is a podcast transcript for your CEO Dario Amodei being interviewed by Elad Gil. Can you 1) summarize the main takeaways and important points made and below that 2) extract all of the questions and a summary of his answer?

The results are generally pretty good. My qualitative assessment is Gemini Pro 1.5 did the best. GPT-4 was second best. Claude 3 Haiku did a decent job which is not really a fair comparison since Haiku is likely a much smaller model than the previous 2. Google has done a good job with their user interface with the markdown toggle as nice touch. One of the best features of Anthropic is how pasted text is distinct from the user entered text in the prompt which is nice from a UI perspective but also likely helps the LLM know what text it is to operate on.

# Gemini Pro 1.5

- Google's gemini-pro-1.5 does the best job of summarizing the main takeaways
- It actually gets every question (Claude 3's Haiku only returned 8 questions)
- It corrected spelling errors in the transcription
- There's a toggle to show the raw markdown (which is really nice!)

# Claude 3 - Haiku

Some of the issues are coming from whisper mis-transcribing "Haiku" as "Iqou", "Sonnet" as "Sonic" etc. If every conference talk had this type of summary, that would be so valuable.
