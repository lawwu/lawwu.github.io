In this post I'll go over some observations I've had while using OpenAI's Code Interpreter for the first time. It is not available as an API, rather only through the ChatGPT web interface for ChatGPT Plus subscribers ($20/month). 

![Code Interpreter](./code_interpreter.png)

If you aren't familiar with Code Interpreter, it is:

- ChatGPT hooked up to a Python interpreter
- You can upload (limited to 100MB, though you can zip files) and download files

Really the only change is a "+" button in the ChatGPT interface but this small change unlocks quite a bit of use cases. One of which is data analysis since you can upload data and have the LLM analyze and reason over it.

Overall I am quite impressed with Code Interpreter's capabilities. I would characterize Code Interpreter as a very capable intern whose output you need to validate. That being said it is a very capable agent in doing data analysis tasks. I would estimate this analyses took me 20 minutes to do. If I actually wanted to do it, I'd estimate it would've taken me 2 hours, so 6x longer. But it's not just a matter of time savings, it is a matter of cognitive-load savings. It was not very cognitively-intense to use Code Interpreter whereas I, a human, doing these analyses would've taken me a lot of mental energy. Because of that, I'd held off on running this type of analyses for a long time (sitting on this idea for a year?) but with Code Interpreter, I was able to do it in 20 minutes. And this opens up many other analyses that I would love to do but have not had the time or energy to do.

# Code Interpreter

OpenAI released Code Interpreter to the public on July 7, 2023. Code Interpreter is GPT-4 hooked up with a Python interpreter with a bunch of different libraries. You can upload any file, CSV files, zipped git repositories, you name it. Given the file you upload and GPT-4, this unlocks quite a bit of use cases. If you haven't seen any before, Ethan Mollick has a bunch of examples [here on his Substack](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/what-ai-can-do-with-a-toolbox-getting).

Someone posted the `requirements.txt` file for Code Interpreter [here](https://gist.github.com/altryne/ee461c27391d4c3990f6bfe1d6a33aa2). It has common libraries like:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- pytorch
- nltk
- spacy
- gensim

There's been a lot of chatter on whether Code Interpreter and models like it will take over data science and data analyst jobs. I don't think that will necessarily happen so soon. I think expert data analysts and data scientists with a tool like Code Interpreter can be much more productive. I haven't used Code Interpreter for very long but right now I see it as a very obedient and capable intern that has a surprising amount of knowledge. You wouldn't productionize code that an intern wrote without a thorough review, nor would you share the results of a data science interns analysis or model without also a thorough review. The same applies to Code Interpreter.

But let me share the results of my first experiment with Code Interpeter and it's ability to do data analysis.

# NBA Data Analysis (Part 1) - Anything interesting?

I'm a fan of the NBA. So one dataset I started with a [dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/nba-player-advanced-metrics/blob/master/nba-data-historical.csv) that had player statistics by year for every NBA player where every row is a player-year. I downloaded this 5.5mb file and uploaded it to Code Interpreter.

![My first prompt into Code Interpreter](./nba-1.png)

The code Code Interpreter runs in its own Python sandbox is by default hidden, you can click show work and there's runnable code! This could be a great training tool for junior data analysts and data scientists. One somewhat surprising thing is this is just a CSV file with no metadata but Code Interpreter was able to infer not just the column data types (which Pandas does already) but the meaning if each column (e.g. "3P%" means 3-point percentage). It's probably based on the colunmn name and the fact I prompted it that it was an NBA related dataset.

```{python}
#| eval: false

import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/nba-data-historical.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
df.head()

#    player_id      name_common  year_id type  age team_id pos  tmRtg franch_id  \
# 0  youngtr01       Trae Young     2020   RS   21     ATL  PG    NaN       ATL   
# 1  huntede01  De'Andre Hunter     2020   RS   22     ATL  SF    NaN       ATL   
# 2  huertke01    Kevin Huerter     2020   RS   21     ATL  SG    NaN       ATL   
# 3  reddica01      Cam Reddish     2020   RS   20     ATL  SF    NaN       ATL   
# 4  collijo01     John Collins     2020   RS   22     ATL  PF    NaN       ATL   

#     G  ...  BLK%  ORtg  %Pos  DRtg  2P%  3P%  FT%  3PAr  FTAr  Pace +/-  
# 0  60  ...   0.3   NaN   NaN   NaN  NaN  NaN  NaN  45.5  44.8       2.9  
# 1  63  ...   0.7   NaN   NaN   NaN  NaN  NaN  NaN  44.5  21.1       0.0  
# 2  56  ...   1.3   NaN   NaN   NaN  NaN  NaN  NaN  54.8  10.5       0.1  
# 3  58  ...   1.5   NaN   NaN   NaN  NaN  NaN  NaN  45.1  22.7       0.9  
# 4  41  ...   4.1   NaN   NaN   NaN  NaN  NaN  NaN  24.3  24.8       0.1  

# [5 rows x 42 columns]
```

But based on "seeing" the first 5 and last 5 rows of the dataset, the agent actually generates 5 interesting questions:

1. The distribution of players' ages.
2. The average performance statistics (like points, assists, rebounds) by player position.
3. Trends in performance over time for specific players.
4. Comparison of teams based on average player statistics.
5. The relationship between different performance metrics (like points and assists).

so naturally I ask it to run all 5 of them.

## 1. Distribution of players' ages

The first use case was simple and the agent was able to do this correctly.

![Players ages](./nba-2.png)

## 2. The average performance statistics (like points, assists, rebounds) by player position.

The second use case was more interesting in the sense it ran into an error producing this analyses but was able to debug itself. It realized the column names were wrong and it was able to find the correct column!

![Self debugging itself](./nba-self-debug.png)

After fixing the issue and finding that the column is `P/36` and not `PTS`, it was able to produce the correct plot.

![After fixing the bug](./nba-use-case-2.png)

## 3. Trends in performance over time for specific players.

The third use case is more complicated but Code Interpreter is able to produce this plot without any issues. You can see the code is more complex and not that trivial to write.

```{python}
#| eval: false

# 3. Trends in performance over time for specific players

# For this plot, let's pick a few popular players to analyze
players_to_analyze = ['LeBron James', 'Kevin Durant', 'Stephen Curry']

# Filter the dataframe for the selected players
player_df = df[df['name_common'].isin(players_to_analyze)]

# Create a list of statistics to analyze
stats_to_analyze = ['P/36', 'A/36', 'R/36']

# Initialize the plot
fig, axes = plt.subplots(len(players_to_analyze), len(stats_to_analyze), figsize=(18, 12))

# Create a subplot for each player and each statistic
for i, player in enumerate(players_to_analyze):
    for j, stat in enumerate(stats_to_analyze):
        player_stat = player_df[player_df['name_common'] == player][['year_id', stat]].dropna()
        axes[i, j].plot(player_stat['year_id'], player_stat[stat])
        axes[i, j].set_title(f'{player} - {stat}')

# Add labels and title
fig.text(0.5, 0.04, 'Year', ha='center', va='center')
fig.text(0.08, 0.5, 'Statistic Value', ha='center', va='center', rotation='vertical')
plt.suptitle('Trends in Performance Over Time for Specific Players (per 36 minutes)')
plt.tight_layout(rect=[0.03, 0.03, 1, 0.95])
plt.show()

```

![3 players performance over time](./nba-use-case-3.png)


## 4. Comparison of teams based on average player statistics.

This plot is not very good as it's a side-by-side bar chat which makes it difficult to compare teams. 

![Comparison of teams based on aveage player stats](./nba-use-case-4.png)

## 5. The relationship between different performance metrics (like points and assists).

This is also not a very good plot but it's a valiant attempt.

![Relationship between differnet performance metrics](./nba-use-case-5.png)

## Explaining itself

I'm surprised that Code Interpreter is able to explain itself. I think it's able to do this by "looking" and examining the plots because that's the only thing the interpreter is generating. The intermediate datasets are generated but not printed out. This is not something I'm completely sure how it's doing it but it's pretty amazing.

![Explaining the insights](./nba-use-case-explained.png)

## Improving number 4 - team statistics

After a couple rounds of modification, I was able to get Code Interpreter to produce a sorted bar chart of team statistics that made it easier to interpret. I found it surprising that some teams like the New York Knicks have some low assists per 36 minutes. It seems like assists are more variable than points and rebounds (which I didn't know before!).

![Team performacne sorted](./nba-use-case-4-sorted.png)

# NBA Data Analysis (Part 2) - Joining Data

I found another dataset that had every player's draft year, round and number. I uploaded it to Code Interpreter. The LLM was smart enough to name the dataframe as `df_new` so it didn't overwride `df` from the previous analysis.

![New dataset uploaded](./nba-dataset-2.png)

With this data, I was interested in seeing if Code Interpreter could join the two datasets and do an analysis that I've always been interested in, are some teams better at drafting (and developing) players? One way to estimate this is to look at the average cumulative WAR (wins above replacement) for players drafted by each team.

## Joining datasets

![Joining the two datasets](./joining_datasets.png)

I was surprised the LLM was able to join the two datasets because it was not a trivial join where the column names from both tables were the same. You can see it had to extract `season` from the `year_id` and then it uses a compound key to join the two tables.

```{python}
#| eval: false

# Merge the two datasets on player name and season/year
# First, we need to create a 'season' column in the first dataset to match with the second dataset

# Extract the season year from 'year_id'
df['season'] = (df['year_id'] - 1).astype(str) + '-' + df['year_id'].astype(str).str[-2:]

# Merge the two datasets
df_merged = pd.merge(df_new, df[['name_common', 'season', 'Raptor WAR']], 
                     left_on=['player_name', 'season'], 
                     right_on=['name_common', 'season'],
                     how='left')

# Display the first few rows of the merged dataframe
df_merged.head()
```

## Average Cumulative WAR by draft position

The LLM produces a fascinating plot with the average cumulative WAR by draft position. You can see the #1 draft pick has a very high average cumulative WAR. There is a strange outlier with #57 draft pick. I probably could've asked Code Interpreter what was going on but I didn't.

![Average Cumulative WAR by draft position](./average_war_by_draft_position.png)


## Cumulative WAR

The LLM is able to produce the following plot which is really interesting! It shows the cumulative WAR for each team for their draft picks. In hindsight I dug a little deeper here because some teams may have higher or more draft picks than others so I should've applied some normalization but I didn't.

![Average Cumulative WAR by team](./average_war_by_team.png)

# NBA Analysis (Part 3) - Embeddings

I had another idea to look at embeddings of players to see if it could generate similar players. So I asked Code Interpreter to generate embeddings for each player based on basketball statisics and physical attributes (weight, height).

Keep in mind these are very simple poor-man's embeddings (PCA with 2 dimensions). If someone really wanted to generate real embeddings you could use OpenAI or sentence-transformers to generate larger more meaningful embeddings but Code Interpreter does not have network access to install new libraries.

In terms of the most similar players to Lebron James, this passes my basketball smell test in that it returns Kobe Bryant, Scottie Pippen, Vince Carter, Draymond Green and Jimmy Butler. This is a key point in that it's important that the users have some expertise to be able to interpret and validate the results. I, having data literacy, Python and basketball am able to do this.

![Embeddings Visualized](./embeddings_plot.png)

# NBA Data Analysis (Part 4) - Variance of WAR

A question that came up as I was interacting with Code Interpreter. I became interested in identifying players who had high variance WAR. I imagine players that have more consistent WAR are more valuable and should command higher salaries.

These are players that had dramatic fluctations in WAR year over year. I imagine this is probably due to injuries.

![Variance of WAR](./high_variance_war_players.png)

I was interested a plot in players that visualized total WAR vs variance in WAR. This would answer questions like which players had really good careers (total WAR) and were consistent (low variance in WAR). It was able to do this. This plot was not very good because there is too much noise.

![Total WAR vs Variance in WAR](./total_vs_variance_war_plot.png)

I asked the LLM to trim the axes and label the points with names. This is common in data analyses tasks where there is this interactive back and forth of seeing the output and iterating to produce a analysis or visualization that makes sense.

![Total WAR vs Variance in WAR - v2](./total_vs_variance_war_plot_v2.png)

# Conclusion

Any data scientist that sees this the first time will probably have a small existential crisis, wondering will my job be automated away too?! I think there will still be a need for data scientists to validate the output of LLMs because what product owner would blindly implement a model that was trained by an LLM agent? But I think this is a good example of how LLMs can be used to augment data scientists' work. This takes Github Copilot's AI assistance to another level. I see there being a few levels to AI assistance:

- Level 0: No AI assistance
- Level 1: AI assistance that helps you write code, [Github Copilot]
- Level 2: AI agent that helps you write code, can reason and debug itself, e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo` + `langchain` [from a previous post](https://lawwu.github.io/posts/2023-07-12-langchain-agents/)
- Level 3: An even more intelligent AI agent that can delight you, [OpenAI's Code Interpreter]
- Level 4: An AI agent that you would trust to run full data analyses, can query it's own data, train it's own models [doesn't exist yet]

For experienced data analysts and data scientists, I can see Code Interpreter being a valuable tool to save time and reduce cognitive load. I'll probably use it to explore new datasets as it's basically [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) on steroids.
