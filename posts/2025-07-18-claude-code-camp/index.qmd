[Every](https://every.to/) hosted a Claude Code Camp today for an hour. Different members from their team shared in detail how they use [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code). I've only started using Claude Code in my developer workflow in the past 2-3 weeks so it was super helpful to see how the team was using it.

## 1. Some of notes and takeaways:

- Compounding Engineering
	- Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units of work easier
	- Loop - These 4 steps below were really helpful!
		- Plan --> plan out a feature or bug fix in detail
			- A lot of prompts to plan. Check if they share it.
		- Delegate -> do the work
		- Assess --> make sure it works as expected
			- Testing
		- Codify --> record learnings for the next time
			- CLAUDE.md
- Some of Kieran Klaasan's tips
	- bash aliases to set up
        - `cc` with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`
        - `wt` create a git worktree
        - `ccw` - run claude code with a git worktree
            - ![](./ccw.png)
	- He had a ton of slash commands saved in `.claude/commands`
        - LOT OF PROMPTS HERE!
        - slash commands
        - issues.md
        - /work 309
            - implements Github issue 309
        - Pull Request review
            - /review - default in claude code
            - /best_practice
    - use monologue for voice to text - <https://monologue.to/>
- Plan
    - Make a context file prompt
        - ![](./context_file_prompt.png)
    - Make an Experiment Log
        - ![](./experiment_log.png)
- Delegate
    - This step is easy when your plan is good
- Assess
	- Other notes
		- Kieran had Claude Code assess itself to understand how to push it
		- Consider alternative methods
		- Make Claude think outside the box
- Codify
	- Dictating to Monologue
	- Take learnings from comments and update CLAUDE.md
		- ![](./learnings.png)
	- Subagents of Claude Code?!
		- Can call up to 10 subagents
		- Use Cases
			- Process Data
			- Opponent processors - agents with different personas
				- Expense report - 1 from my own perspective, 2 from an auditor's perspective
- Other tools
	- vibe tunnel - <https://github.com/amantus-ai/vibetunnel>
	- claude-prune
        - <https://x.com/DannyAziz97/status/1945958948227461329>
		- <https://github.com/DannyAziz/claude-prune>
	- Claude Conductor: <https://github.com/superbasicstudio/claude-conductor>
- Quotes:
	- Someone asked a question around you guys all have different ways of approaching plans
		- Alex Duffy: "AI is a leverage for your subject matter expertise"
		- Kieran: Be inspired by what others do

Below are some learnings extracted by o3 from the transcribed transcript.

## 2. Key Learnings (Top 5–10)
- Claude Code enables shipping features in unfamiliar codebases far faster than traditional onboarding.
- Productivity follows a repeatable loop: **Plan → Delegate → Assess → Codify**.
- Strong up‑front plans let agents “just build” while poor plans create rework.
- GitHub issues and PRs are the contract between Claude and humans for traceability.
- Dictation (e.g., Monologue) captures richer prompts; voice often beats typing.
- Folder‑level context files shrink token usage and boost model accuracy.
- Keep **experiment logs** so goals, findings, and next steps survive context resets.
- **Subagents** provide parallel processing and multiple viewpoints.
- Codify every PR lesson into commands or `Claude.md` to create compounding returns.
- Git worktrees, session‑pruning, and remote terminals keep multi‑feature work safe and light.

---

## 3. Actionable Advice
- Start with one simple planning command; iterate after each run.
- Auto‑generate a GitHub issue from the plan; use `/work <issue>` to delegate.
- Use multi‑persona reviews (strict bot + human style) on each PR.
- Distill review comments into updated best‑practice commands or `Claude.md`.
- Summarize each folder in an `llms.txt` or similar for leaner context loading.
- Maintain an **experiment_log.md** with goals, errors and revised plans.
- Explicitly ask for parallel subagents when processing large corpora.
- Adopt TDD in plans; require failing tests before code generation.
- Use dictation tools to give fuller context rapidly.
- Employ git worktrees (or Conductor UI) for parallel agent branches; prune chat history regularly.

## 4. Memorable Quotes
> “Claude Code has radically altered the way we work—processes, parameters, mental models—everything.” — Dan

> “I shipped two features this week in codebases I’d never touched; that shouldn’t be possible.” — Dan

> “Each unit of engineering should make the next one easier—that’s compounding engineering.” — Dan

> “If your plan is amazing, the feature basically builds itself.” — Dan

> “CC is my alias that starts Claude Code bypassing permissions—so it just works.” — Kieran

> “Forty‑five minutes of uninterrupted Claude work is my personal record.” — Kieran

> “Make your own system; be inspired, but tailor it to your workflow.” — Kieran

> “Voice prompts give fuller context; I get better results than typing.” — Naveen

> “AI is leverage for your subject‑matter expertise.” — Alex

> “Let it run, move on, come back when it’s done—that’s the mindset shift.” — Kieran

> “Don’t juggle mega‑prompts; lean into agents and their tools.” — Kieran

> “Experiment logs keep the model honest across context resets.” — Alex

> “Reviewing with strict TypeScript bot against Ruby creates constructive tension.” — Kieran

> “Prune old chat instead of trusting weak auto‑summaries.” — Danny

## 5. Important Data / Stats / Frameworks
- **Compounding Engineering Loop:** Plan → Delegate → Assess → Codify.
- **Time‑Savings Example:** Two unfamiliar‑codebase features shipped in a week vs. ~2‑3 weeks ramp‑up each.
- **Continuous Work Duration:** 45‑minute single Claude session noted.
- **Business‑Model Change (Monologue):** Paid‑only to freemium cap (~2 k words) requiring full‑stack update.
- **Parallelization:** Up to 10 subagents requested for concurrent processing.
- **Subscription Bundle:** Every subscription includes Cora, Monologue, Spiral, Sparkle at no add’l cost.
- **Context Principle:** Larger windows can hurt accuracy; mitigate with hierarchical summaries.
- **Bug‑avoidance Strategy:** Multi‑model reviews, experiment logs, TDD catch shortcut fixes.
- **Session Management:** Use `world prune` to keep recent N messages; avoid poor auto‑summaries.

## 6. Suggested Follow‑up Resources
- **Claude Code** terminal agent (Anthropic)
- **Claude.md / folder context files** (`/init`)
- **Custom `/issues`, `/work`, `/review` commands**
- **Monologue** dictation app
- **Cora** email chief‑of‑staff; **Spiral** copywriter; **Sparkle** desktop organizer
- **AI Diplomacy** game (Alex)
- **Warp Terminal**; **Vibe Tunnel** (remote terminal)
- **World Prune** (`npx world prune`) chat‑trim tool
- **Conductor** git‑worktree UI
- **Every Newsletter, Discord, Consulting** for ongoing training & content.

## 7. One‑Sentence Summary (25 words)
Every’s team demonstrates how Claude Code enables “compounding engineering”—plan, delegate, assess, codify—to ship multi‑codebase features rapidly by capturing and recycling best‑practice knowledge.
