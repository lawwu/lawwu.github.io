This is the first time I'm taking some time to do a year in review and posting it on my blog. Overall I've enjoyed the exercise of writing and sharing ideas and things I've learned across a variety of topics with others. The main categories I've written about thus far are about AI and personal finances. I wrote my first [book review](https://lawwu.github.io/posts/2025-11-24-little-theology-of-exercise/) and would like to write more of those. I'd like to also continue blogging next year.

## Blogging

I started blogging in 2023. The first post I wrote was about [useful Mac applications](https://lawwu.github.io/posts/2023-03-24-mac-apps/){target="_blank"}. I wrote 20 posts in 2023, 11 posts in 2024 and 16 posts in 2025. Right now I mostly share my posts on Facebook and LinkedIn. The most popular posts by views:

## Personal Finances

### Investments

I stopped trading individual securities around 10 years ago. I’m content just earning the market return year in and year out, without needing to choose the best stocks, fund managers or sector ETFs. I don’t need to monitor them for when to sell them. I don’t need to worry about quarterly earnings. The market and low-cost market-cap index funds/ETFs weighted are one of the greatest innovations that retail investors like myself have access to. If you buy and hold these investment vehicles, you’ll likely beat 90+% of professional money managers.

My portfolio hasn't changed over the last 5 years. It is:

- 90% stocks
- 10% cash

The stock portion is:

- 70% US Stocks
- 30% International

The funds I own are either US funds like a total stock VTI or an S&P 500 fund like FXAIX, international funds (VXUS, FTIHX, FSPSX), a world fund like VT or a Bitcoin ETF (FBTC).

Here are the 70/30 US/International portfolio returns since 2016:

| Year | 70/30 Returns |
|------|---------------|
| 2016 | 10.4% |
| 2017 | 23.1% |
| 2018 | -8.0% |
| 2019 | 28.0% |
| 2020 | 17.9% |
| 2021 | 20.5% |
| 2022 | -18.3% |
| 2023 | 22.4% |
| 2024 | 18.6% |
| 2025 | 22.4% |

It's been an amazing 10 year run. 8 years of 10+% gains, 7 of them have been 15% or more. Only 2 down years.

```{python}
#| echo: false

import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas as pd

# Investment returns data
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Year': [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025],
    '70/30 Returns': [10.4, 23.1, -8.0, 28.0, 17.9, 20.5, -18.3, 22.4, 18.6, 22.4]
})

# Create bar chart
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Bar(
        name='70/30 Benchmark',
        x=df['Year'],
        y=df['70/30 Returns'],
        marker_color='#2563eb',
        hovertemplate='<b>%{x}</b><br>70/30 Returns: %{y}%<extra></extra>'
    )
])

# Update layout
fig.update_layout(
    title='70/30 US/International Portfolio Returns (2016-2025)',
    xaxis_title='Year',
    yaxis_title='Annual Return (%)',
    yaxis=dict(gridcolor='lightgray', zeroline=True, zerolinecolor='#666', zerolinewidth=1),
    plot_bgcolor='white',
    width=800,
    height=400,
    showlegend=False
)

fig.show()
```

### Cash / Emergency Fund

I no longer own any I-Bonds. I sold my last ones in 2024. All of our cash / emergency funds is in a Fidelity CMA account that currently earns 3.42%. All of it is automatically invested in SPAXX, Fidelity's Government Money Market Fund. One of the great things about a CMA account is you can pay bills from it and Fidelity will sell your core cash position (SPAXX is the default) to pay the bill. The Frugal Professor has written a post on the Fidelity CMA [here](https://frugalprofessor.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-fidelitys-cash-management-account-cma/).

### Credit Cards

The US Bank Smartly 4% cash back card came and went. It was a little too good to be true and I got the infamous [bad letter](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/u-s-bank-to-nerf-existing-smartly-cardholders-on-september-15/) in September. I moved all of our credit card spending to the [BofA Premium Rewards Elite](https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/products/premium-rewards-elite-credit-card/) where I earn 3.5% on travel/dining and 2.625% on all other spend.

I got a couple credit card sign up bonuses this year:

- American Express - Marriott Bonvoy Bevy - 155,000 Marriott points
- American Express - Platinum - 80,000 MR points

The Amex Platinum takes a fair amount of work to maximize it's rewards. I don't really like the overhead and probably won't keep it.

## Biblical Counseling

I started working toward a Biblical Counseling certificiation through ACBC in 2021. Phase 1 was relatively painless. Phase 2 has been much more of a slog. I finally finished my last essay. One of biggest motivations for pursuing this path was because I wanted to counsel myself and my family in a more Biblical manner. Through going through this process, some things I learned:

- Everyone counsels - if you talk to people and give advice, you are "unoffiically counseling" people. As a Christian, if I believe the Bible is the greatest source of authority, literally the Word of God or God's words, then my advice/counsel should be based on the Bible.
- The sufficiency of Scripture - this is a theological term that means the Bible contains all that we need to live out the Christian life. Wayne Grudem defines sufficiency as it *"means that Scripture contains all the words of God we need for salvation, for trusting him perfectly, and for obeying him perfectly. This definition emphasizes that it is in Scripture alone that we are to search for God’s words to us. It also reminds us that God considers what he has told us in the Bible to be enough for us and that we should rejoice in the great revelation he has given us and be content with it.”* (Systematic Theology, page 333-334) More than my experiences, traditions or worldly wisdom, Scripture is what I need to go back to find answers.
- AI can write a pretty good ACBC essay. However, the value in writing these essays (and writing in general) is gives you the writer an opportunity to process what you've learned. [Writing is thinking](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44222-025-00323-4). As we enter the age of AI, I actually believe thinking is even more important. We cannot allow AI to think for us. Having to write essays on a variety of theological and counseling based situations gave me an opportunity to consume material on the topic, synthesize the material into an outline and then bring it all together by writing hopefully coherent paragraphs.

## AI & Agentic Coding

One of the big changes this year was the rise of agentic coding tools like Claude Code. I started using it in [July 2025](https://lawwu.github.io/posts/2025-07-18-starting-to-use-claude-code/) and have been using it almost daily since it came out. Anthropic has created an amazing tool. We've seen the underlying model improve. It's still hard to believe the intial release of Claude Code used Claude 3.7 Sonnet (I would've guessed this was last year)! We're now on Claude Opus 4.5. There has also been improvements in the Claude Code agentic harness too with todo lists, subagents, improvements to the system prompts, better tool calling, adding agent skills. Just look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to look at all these improvements over time. 

Some of the things I've used Claude Code for this year:

- Agentic ML: using the `bq` cli to explore data source in Big Query, create ML features and create ML training scripts
- Exploring and understanding new code using the `gh` cli - I find Claude Code is more effective at using CLI tools than an MCP Server. I prefer Claude Code using the Github CLI rather than the Github MCP
- Creating slides that are themed according to my company using Quarto and RevealJS
- Troubleshooting Kubernetes pods
- Writing documentation 
- Writing Confluence documentation using the [mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) MCP Server
- Adding graphs / visuals to my blg posts
- Creating Github Actions
- Creating and maintaining Cookiecutter templates for Python libraries and services

Claude Code really does amplify and leverage a developer's (or even non-developer's) ideas. Whatever ideas you have, you can bring them into reality so much faster.

There are many world class software developers that now use tools like Claude Code:

**Andrej Karpathy** - [Year in Review where he talks about Claude Code and Vibe Coding](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2002118205729562949)

**Boris Cherny**

> A year ago, Claude struggled to generate bash commands without escaping issues. It worked for seconds or minutes at a time. We saw early signs that it may become broadly useful for coding one day.
> Fast forward to today. In the last thirty days, I landed 259 PRs -- 497 commits, 40k lines added, 38k lines removed. Every single line was written by Claude Code + Opus 4.5. Claude consistently runs for minutes, hours, and days at a time (using Stop hooks). Software engineering is changing, and we are entering a new period in coding history. And we're still just getting started..
