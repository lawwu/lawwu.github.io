I had the privilege of attending LangChain's first conference. The first day was a hands-on workshop going through the creation of an agent (an email assistant) from scratch. It went through many of the components of building an agent:

- Overview of LangGraph
- Writing the Agent
- Evaluation / Testing
- Human Feedback
- Memory

## Code

- Python: [https://github.com/langchain-ai/agents-from-scratch](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agents-from-scratch)
- Typescript: [https://github.com/langchain-ai/agents-from-scratch-ts](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agents-from-scratch-ts) (this is the first time I've seen Typescript Jupyter notebooks)

## Notebook 1: LangGraph 101

Notebook: [langgraph_101.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agents-from-scratch/blob/main/notebooks/langgraph_101.ipynb)

Lance Martin gave an overview of LangGraph that was largely review. It was a good reminder that "tool calling is just structured output."

LangGraph code to create the agent:

```python
from typing import Literal
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState
from email_assistant.utils import show_graph

def call_llm(state: MessagesState) -> MessagesState:
    """Run LLM"""

    output = model_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [output]}

# actually what happens when a tool call is made
def run_tool(state: MessagesState):
    """Performs the tool call"""

    result = []
    for tool_call in state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
        observation = write_email.invoke(tool_call["args"])
        result.append({"role": "tool", "content": observation, "tool_call_id": tool_call["id"]})
    return {"messages": result}

def should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal["run_tool", END]:
    """Route to tool handler, or end if Done tool called"""

    # Get the last message
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]

    # If the last message is a tool call, check if it's a Done tool call
    if last_message.tool_calls:
        return "run_tool"
    # Otherwise, we stop (reply to the user)
    return END

workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
workflow.add_node("call_llm", call_llm)
workflow.add_node("run_tool", run_tool)
workflow.add_edge(START, "call_llm")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("call_llm", should_continue, {"run_tool": "run_tool", END: END})
workflow.add_edge("run_tool", END)

# Run the workflow
app = workflow.compile()
```


## Notebook 2: Building the Agent

Notebook: [agent.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agents-from-scratch/blob/main/notebooks/agent.ipynb)

Example Code for the Router in LangGraph

- `Command` does control flow AND state up dates in one
- In the example below: `return Command(goto=goto, update=update)`

```python
class RouterSchema(BaseModel):
    """Analyze the unread email and route it according to its content."""

    reasoning: str = Field(
        description="Step-by-step reasoning behind the classification."
    )
    classification: Literal["ignore", "respond", "notify"] = Field(
        description="The classification of an email: 'ignore' for irrelevant emails, "
        "'notify' for important information that doesn't need a response, "
        "'respond' for emails that need a reply",
    )

# Initialize the LLM for use with router / structured output
llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4.1", temperature=0.0)
llm_router = llm.with_structured_output(RouterSchema)

def triage_router(state: State) -> Command[Literal["response_agent", END]]:
    """Analyze email content to decide if we should respond, notify, or ignore."""

    author, to, subject, email_thread = parse_email(state["email_input"])
    system_prompt = triage_system_prompt.format(
        background=default_background,
        triage_instructions=default_triage_instructions
    )

    user_prompt = triage_user_prompt.format(
        author=author, to=to, subject=subject, email_thread=email_thread
    )

    result = llm_router.invoke(
        [
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt},
        ]
    )

    if result.classification == "respond":
        print("📧 Classification: RESPOND - This email requires a response")
        goto = "response_agent"
        update = {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": f"Respond to the email: \n\n{format_email_markdown(subject, author, to, email_thread)}",
                }
            ],
            "classification_decision": result.classification,
        }
    elif result.classification == "ignore":
        print("🚫 Classification: IGNORE - This email can be safely ignored")
        goto = END
        update =  {
            "classification_decision": result.classification,
        }
    elif result.classification == "notify":
        print("🔔 Classification: NOTIFY - This email contains important information")
        # For now, we go to END. But we will add to this later!
        goto = END
        update = {
            "classification_decision": result.classification,
        }
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid classification: {result.classification}")
    return Command(goto=goto, update=update)
```

You can add agents in nodes in LangGraph:

- xray show true shows it
- If a LangGraph agent is deployed in LangGraph platform, I think I can also use this as a Remote Graph


## Notebook 3: Evaluating the Agent

Notebook: [evaluation](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agents-from-scratch/blob/main/notebooks/evaluation.ipynb)

- When thinking of evaluations, if an expected input does not have a static expected output, you can define "Response Criteria" which a LLM as Judge could take in.
- Below is an example with "Response Criteria"

```python
/Users/lawrence.wu/github/agents-from-scratch

Email Input: {'author': 'Alice Smith <alice.smith@company.com>', 'to': 'Lance Martin <lance@company.com>', 'subject': 'Quick question about API documentation', 'email_thread': "Hi Lance,\n\nI was reviewing the API documentation for the new authentication service and noticed a few endpoints seem to be missing from the specs. Could you help clarify if this was intentional or if we should update the docs?\n\nSpecifically, I'm looking at:\n- /auth/refresh\n- /auth/validate\n\nThanks!\nAlice"}
Expected Triage Output: respond
Expected Tool Calls: ['write_email', 'done']
Response Criteria:
• Send email with write_email tool call to acknowledge the question and confirm it will be investigated

```


```python
all_messages_str = format_messages_string(response['messages'])
eval_result = criteria_eval_structured_llm.invoke([
        {"role": "system",
            "content": RESPONSE_CRITERIA_SYSTEM_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user",
            "content": f"""\n\n Response criteria: {success_criteria} \n\n Assistant's response: \n\n {all_messages_str} \n\n Evaluate whether the assistant's response meets the criteria and provide justification for your evaluation."""}
    ])
eval_result
```

new interrupt node

```python
def triage_interrupt_handler(state: State) -> Command[Literal["response_agent", "__end__"]]:
    """Handles interrupts from the triage step."""

    # Parse the email input
    author, to, subject, email_thread = parse_email(state["email_input"])

    # Create email markdown for Agent Inbox in case of notification
    email_markdown = format_email_markdown(subject, author, to, email_thread)

    # Create messages
    messages = [{"role": "user",
                "content": f"Email to notify user about: {email_markdown}"
                }]


    # Create interrupt that is shown to the user
    # This request schema is what Agent Inbox expects
    request = {
        "action_request": {
            "action": f"Email Assistant: {state['classification_decision']}",
            "args": {}
        },
        "config": {
            "allow_ignore": True,
            "allow_respond": True,
            "allow_edit": False,
            "allow_accept": False,
        },
        # Email to show in Agent Inbox
        "description": email_markdown,
    }

    # Agent Inbox responds with a list of dicts with a single key `type` that can be `accept`, `edit`, `ignore`, or `response`.
    response = interrupt([request])[0]

    # If user provides feedback, go to response agent and use feedback to respond to email
    if response["type"] == "response":
        # Add feedback to messages
        user_input = response["args"]
        # Used by the response agent
        messages.append({"role": "user",
                        "content": f"User wants to reply to the email. Use this feedback to respond: {user_input}"
                        })
        # Go to response agent
        goto = "response_agent"

    # If user ignores email, go to END
    elif response["type"] == "ignore":
        goto = END

    # Catch all other responses
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid response: {response}")

    # Update the state
    update = {
        "messages": messages,
    }

    return Command(goto=goto, update=update)
```

Actually thinking through all of the different use cases and how it affects the workflow of the agent is important. Pretty complicated even just for a simple email assistant.

Interrupt handler, define the config for each node

```python
def interrupt_handler(state: State) -> Command[Literal["llm_call", "__end__"]]:

## Notebook 4: Human-in-the-loop

Notebook: [hitl.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agents-from-scratch/blob/main/notebooks/hitl.ipynb)

This was a very interesting demo showcasing how a LangGraph agent that has an interrupt, can send that interrupt to a UI, in this case [Agent Inbox](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-inbox). A human can give that feedback in the Agent Inbox UI and the LangGraph graph will take that feedback and continue processing.

## Notebook 5: Memory

Notebook: [memory.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agents-from-scratch/blob/main/notebooks/memory.ipynb)


Update memory instructions - some of this was taken from the gpt-4.1 prompting guide

```python
MEMORY_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS = """
# Role and Objective
You are a memory profile manager for an email assistant agent that selectively updates user preferences based on feedback messages from human-in-the-loop interactions with the email assistant.

# Instructions
- NEVER overwrite the entire memory profile
- ONLY make targeted additions of new information
- ONLY update specific facts that are directly contradicted by feedback messages
- PRESERVE all other existing information in the profile
- Format the profile consistently with the original style
- Generate the profile as a string

# Reasoning Steps
1. Analyze the current memory profile structure and content
2. Review feedback messages from human-in-the-loop interactions
3. Extract relevant user preferences from these feedback messages (such as edits to emails/calendar invites, explicit feedback on assistant performance, user decisions to ignore certain emails)
4. Compare new information against existing profile
5. Identify only specific facts to add or update
6. Preserve all other existing information
7. Output the complete updated profile

# Example
<memory_profile>
RESPOND:
- wife
- specific questions
- system admin notifications
NOTIFY:
- meeting invites
IGNORE:
- marketing emails
- company-wide announcements
- messages meant for other teams
</memory_profile>

<user_messages>
"The assistant shouldn't have responded to that system admin notification."
</user_messages>

<updated_profile>
RESPOND:
- wife
- specific questions
NOTIFY:
- meeting invites
- system admin notifications
IGNORE:
- marketing emails
- company-wide announcements
- messages meant for other teams
</updated_profile>

# Process current profile for {namespace}
<memory_profile>
{current_profile}
</memory_profile>

Think step by step about what specific feedback is being provided and what specific information should be added or updated in the profile while preserving everything else."""

MEMORY_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS_REINFORCEMENT = """
Remember:
- NEVER overwrite the entire profile
- ONLY make targeted additions or changes based on explicit feedback
- PRESERVE all existing information not directly contradicted
- Output the complete updated profile as a string
"""
```

Update Memory function, notably

- this uses structured output to do the updating

```python
class UserPreferences(BaseModel):
    """User preferences."""
    preferences: str
    justification: str

def update_memory(store, namespace, messages):
    """Update memory profile in the store.

    Args:
        store: LangGraph BaseStore instance to update memory
        namespace: Tuple defining the memory namespace, e.g. ("email_assistant", "triage_preferences")
        messages: List of messages to update the memory with
    """

    # Get the existing memory
