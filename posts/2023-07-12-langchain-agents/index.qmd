# Agents with `langchain`

I'm currently working my way through the [Databricks LLM101x Course on EdX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Databricks+LLM101x+2T2023/c). It's actually pretty good. During the third section, there was this interesting example where they created a data science agent called `DaScie`. Given a prompt, the agent was able to carry out some interesting tasks.

## Setting Up the Agent

First to define the agent using `langchain`, `OpenAI` and then giving it some tools.
```{python}
#| eval: false

# For DaScie we need to load in some tools for it to use, as well as an LLM for the brain/reasoning
from langchain.agents import load_tools  # This will allow us to load tools we need
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import (
    AgentType,
)  # We will be using the type: ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION which is standard
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# For OpenAI we'll use the default model for DaScie
llm = OpenAI()
tools = load_tools(["wikipedia", "serpapi", "python_repl", "terminal"], llm=llm)
# We now create DaScie using the "initialize_agent" command.
dascie = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True
)
```

## Simple Example

To run the agent, you just pass an instruction:
```{python}
#| eval: false

dascie.run(
    "Create a dataset (DO NOT try to download one, you MUST create one based on what you find) on the performance of the Mercedes AMG F1 team in 2020 and do some analysis. You need to plot your results."
)
```

The output is:
```{python}
#| eval: false

# Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
#  I need to find some data on the Mercedes AMG F1 team that I can use to create a dataset.
# Action: Search
# Action Input: "Mercedes AMG F1 team 2020 performance"
# Observation: The Mercedes team set new lap records during Grands Prix at eight different tracks in 2020, with five falling to Hamilton, two to Bottas, and one to Russell, crushing records held since the V10 era.
# Thought: I can use this information to create a dataset to analyze the performance of the Mercedes AMG F1 team in 2020.
# Action: Python REPL
# Action Input: data = [("Grand Prix", "Driver", "Lap Record"), ("Austria", "Lewis Hamilton", "1:04.304"), ("Hungary", "Lewis Hamilton", "1:15.144"), ("Britain", "Valtteri Bottas", "1:25.093"), ("Spain", "Lewis Hamilton", "1:18.170"), ("Belgium", "Lewis Hamilton", "1:42.216"), ("Italy", "Valtteri Bottas", "1:19.307"), ("Russia", "George Russell", "1:30.737"), ("Bahrain", "Lewis Hamilton", "1:27.264")]
# Observation: 
# Thought: I have created the dataset. Now I can plot the results.
# Action: Python REPL
# Action Input: 

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
y = [1.04304, 1.15144, 1.25093, 1.18170, 1.42216, 1.19307, 1.30737, 1.27264]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Mercedes AMG F1 Team 2020 Performance')
plt.xlabel('Grand Prix')
plt.ylabel('Lap Record')
plt.show()
```

After generating the plot, the agent concludes that it has finished the task.
```{python}
#| eval: false

# Observation: 
# Thought: I now have a graph of the Mercedes AMG F1 team's performance in 2020.
# Final Answer: The Mercedes AMG F1 team achieved great lap records at eight different tracks in 2020, with five falling to Lewis Hamilton, two to Valtteri Bottas, and one to George Russell. A graph of their performance can be seen below. (graph should be included)

# > Finished chain.

```

## Passing Data to the Agent

You can actually pass data to `langchain` agents using `create_pandas_dataframe_agent`
```{python}
#| eval: false

from langchain.agents import create_pandas_dataframe_agent
import pandas as pd

datasci_data_df = pd.read_csv("salaries/ds_salaries.csv")
# world_data
dascie = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(
    OpenAI(temperature=0), datasci_data_df, verbose=True
)
```

Now we can run the agent again:
```{python}
#| eval: false

dascie.run("Analyze this data, tell me any interesting trends. Make some pretty plots.")

# > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
# Thought: I should look at the data and see what I can find.
# Action: python_repl_ast
# Action Input: df.describe()
# Observation:          work_year        salary  salary_in_usd  remote_ratio
# count  3755.000000  3.755000e+03    3755.000000   3755.000000
# mean   2022.373635  1.906956e+05  137570.389880     46.271638
# std       0.691448  6.716765e+05   63055.625278     48.589050
# min    2020.000000  6.000000e+03    5132.000000      0.000000
# 25%    2022.000000  1.000000e+05   95000.000000      0.000000
# 50%    2022.000000  1.380000e+05  135000.000000      0.000000
# 75%    2023.000000  1.800000e+05  175000.000000    100.000000
# max    2023.000000  3.040000e+07  450000.000000    100.000000
# Thought: I can see that the average salary is around $190,000 and the average salary in USD is around $137,570. The remote ratio is around 46%.
# Action: python_repl_ast
# Action Input: df.groupby('experience_level')['salary_in_usd'].mean().plot(kind='bar')
# Observation: AxesSubplot(0.125,0.11;0.775x0.77)
# Thought: I can see that the average salary in USD increases with experience level.
# Action: python_repl_ast
# Action Input: df.groupby('employment_type')['salary_in_usd'].mean().plot(kind='bar')
# Observation: AxesSubplot(0.125,0.11;0.775x0.77)
# Thought: I can see that the average salary in USD is higher for full-time employees than for contract employees.
# Action: python_repl_ast
# ...
# Thought: I now know the final answer.
# Final Answer: The average salary in USD increases with experience level, is higher for full-time employees than for contract employees, and increases with company size.

# > Finished chain.
```

The plot the agent generates is:

![Agent Salaries](./agent_salaries_plot.png)

## Can the agent train a model?

```{python}
#| eval: false

# Not bad! Now for something even more complex.... can we get out LLM model do some ML!?
dascie.run(
    "Train a random forest regressor to predict salary using the most important features. Show me the what variables are most influential to this model"
)
```

The agent struggles with indentation but is able to self-debug and fix the issue. When I ran this, I was surprised `gpt-3.5-turbo` + `langchain` was able to do this.

```{python}
#| eval: false

```

I'm actually quite surprised that this simple langchain agent was able to do so much.
