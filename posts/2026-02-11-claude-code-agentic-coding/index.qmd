As a daily Claude Code user for [the last 6 months](https://lawwu.github.io/posts/2025-07-18-starting-to-use-claude-code/), I've learned a lot about Claude Code and agentic coding in general. Trying this thing where I share 1 thing per day. I'm posting on LinkedIn but I'll update this post with each tip.

## Day 1 - `/insights` command

[Posted on 2026-02-10](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lawrencewu920_if-you-use-more-than-one-coding-agent-like-activity-7427504846313836544-Azs9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAE5gYIBXATpK1K66bvyVE0Gc0prVDW-82g)

I tried the new /insights command in Claude Code in one of my main projects. It analyzed the last 30 days of messages in my project, identified how I work, noted "impressive things" I did, where things went wrong, suggested existing Claude Code features to try which included recommendations to updates to my CLAUDE.md, and new Custom Skills and Hooks to try.

Also neat to see all of the messages, tool calls and sessions labeled by type along with the distribution of my response time and how often I am "Multi-Clauding." Finally, all those days of micro'ing while playing Starcraft and Warcraft III are paying off.

## Day 2 - Standardize on `AGENTS.md`

[Posted on 2026-02-11](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lawrencewu920_if-you-use-more-than-one-coding-agent-like-activity-7427504846313836544-Azs9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAE5gYIBXATpK1K66bvyVE0Gc0prVDW-82g)

If you use more than one coding agent like Claude Code and Codex, it's helpful to standardize on one AGENTS.md. This is a file that gets loaded into the model's system prompt and is great for steering the model. Claude Code hasn't chosen to standardize yet and still uses at CLAUDE.md

Solution: Have CLAUDE.md with one line:
```md
@AGENTS.md
```
Then just keep your AGENTS.md updated. 

Codex will use AGENTS.md as normal. Claude Code will load CLAUDE.md and then load AGENTS.md because it's referred to.

In Claude Code, if you type /memory, you should see under Project Memory your AGENTS.md referenced.
