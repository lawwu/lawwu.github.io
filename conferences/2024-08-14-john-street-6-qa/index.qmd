2. Encourage them to consider whether their relationship leads to greater holiness for both partners.

## [Q9: How do I make my husband a priority when I have a career?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVyerCbKlvY&t=2164s)

Dr. Street advises:
1. It's not wrong for a woman to have a career, but it shouldn't dictate family priorities.
