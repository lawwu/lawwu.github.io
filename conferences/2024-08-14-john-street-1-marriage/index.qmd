## Overview

John Street's marriage seminar presents a biblical perspective on the institution of marriage, emphasizing its divine origin and purpose. The central message is that God designed marriage as a covenant relationship primarily for companionship, not procreation or personal fulfillment. Street argues against contemporary societal views that undermine the permanence and sanctity of marriage, using Scripture to support his points.

Throughout the seminar, Street uses biblical passages, particularly from Genesis, to illustrate God's intentions for marriage. He contrasts these with modern concepts like trial marriages and robotic companions, arguing that these deviate from God's design. The seminar emphasizes the importance of commitment over feelings, the permanence of the marital relationship compared to the temporary nature of the parent-child relationship, and the concept of "becoming one flesh" in all aspects of life.

Street's approach to marriage is deeply rooted in biblical teaching, presenting a conservative, traditional view of marital roles and purposes. He challenges modern cultural norms and encourages couples to base their marriages on God's design rather than societal trends or personal desires.
