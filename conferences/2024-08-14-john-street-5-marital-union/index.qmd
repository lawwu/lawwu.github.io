## Overview

John Street's marriage seminar focuses on presenting a biblical view of sexuality within marriage. The central message emphasizes that sex is a pure, holy, and God-designed aspect of marriage, intended for mutual satisfaction and enjoyment between spouses. Street argues against both extremes of viewing sex as dirty or taboo and seeing it as the highest form of human relationship.

Throughout the seminar, Street uses biblical passages to support his main points, drawing primarily from 1 Corinthians 7, Proverbs 5, and other relevant verses. He emphasizes that the Bible presents sex as a good gift from God, but one that should be expressed exclusively within the confines of a heterosexual, monogamous marriage. The arguments and verses are used to reinforce the idea that sexual intimacy in marriage should be characterized by mutual giving, equal rights and responsibilities, and regular engagement.

Street's approach to marriage and sexuality is deeply rooted in biblical principles, challenging cultural norms and encouraging couples to view their sexual relationship as a ministry to each other. He stresses the importance of putting one's spouse's needs and satisfaction above personal gratification, presenting this as a reflection of Christ-like love and service within marriage.
