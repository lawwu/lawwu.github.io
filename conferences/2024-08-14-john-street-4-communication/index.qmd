## Overview

John Street's marriage seminar focuses on the importance of godly communication in Christian marriages. The central message emphasizes that good communication doesn't happen automatically, even in Christian relationships, and that every marriage faces challenges due to the sinful nature of humans. Street argues against the popular notion of compatibility, asserting that conflicts arise not from personality differences but from internal desires and passions.

The seminar is structured around four main rules of communication derived from Ephesians 4: be honest, keep current, attack the problem (not the person), and act (don't react). Street uses various Bible verses to support these points, particularly drawing from Ephesians and James. He emphasizes the need for Christians to not only stop negative communication patterns but also actively practice positive ones.

Street's approach to marriage is deeply rooted in biblical principles, focusing on personal responsibility, forgiveness, and the pursuit of godliness in marital relationships. He stresses the importance of understanding the root causes of conflicts and addressing them promptly and lovingly. The seminar provides practical applications for implementing these communication rules in daily life, encouraging couples to be intentional about changing their habits to align with biblical teachings.

Throughout the seminar, there is a recurring theme of the transformative power of applying biblical principles to marriage. Street consistently emphasizes the need for deliberate effort in changing communication patterns and the importance of viewing one's spouse through the lens of grace and forgiveness. His teaching style combines theological explanation with practical examples, making the content accessible and applicable to his audience.
