## Overview

John Street's marriage seminar focuses on the biblical roles of husbands and wives, emphasizing the concept of submission within marriage. The central message revolves around the idea that following God's design for marriage leads to harmony and happiness, while deviating from it results in conflict and misery.

Street uses various Bible verses to support his arguments, primarily drawing from Ephesians, 1 Peter, and 1 Timothy. He presents a complementarian view of marriage, where husbands and wives have distinct roles that work together for the good of the relationship. The seminar addresses common misconceptions about submission and argues that it is not demeaning or oppressive when properly understood and applied.

Throughout the seminar, Street emphasizes the importance of wives respecting and honoring their husbands, while also encouraging wives to use their intellect and abilities to complement their husbands. He presents a view of marriage where the husband is the leader, but the wife plays a crucial role as a "suitable helper" and influential partner.
