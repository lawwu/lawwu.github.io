I often get asked how to stay up to date with AI. Here are some of my sources.

# Newsletters

I find email newsletters still to be a fantastic source of information. Easily skimmable. I usually learn 1-2 new things from each of these.

- AI News: <http://news.smol.ai/>
- Latent Space: <https://www.latent.space/>
- Every: <https://every.to/newsletter>
- Pragmatic Engineer: <https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/>
- PulseMCP: <https://www.pulsemcp.com/>
- [Data Science Programming News](https://dspn.substack.com/) - Run by [Eric J Ma](https://ericmjl.github.io/)

# Blogs/Websites (I use [Feedly](https://feedly.com/))

- Simon Willison: <https://simonwillison.net/>
- Hackernews: <https://news.ycombinator.com/>
- Karpathy has a blog: <https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/>
- Ben Thompson: <https://stratechery.com/>
- Jay Alammar: <https://jalammar.github.io/>

# YouTube

Note, I don't always watch a YouTube video in full. It's easy to transcribe videos now ever since [Whisper](https://lawwu.github.io/posts/2023-11-15-whisper-transcripts/) came out. I transcribe some YouTube channels [here](https://lawwu.github.io/transcripts/), see the project called [transcripts](https://github.com/lawwu/transcripts). I'll also use [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download videos and transcribe them with [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper).
