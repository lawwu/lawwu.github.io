## Hello! 👋

I am a Principal level data scientist and ML/AI engineer who codes daily and ships reliable systems. I enjoy deriving business value out of data, training ML models and building AI systems using common protocols like [MCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp), [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) and agent frameworks like [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) along with robust evals (that run in CI/CD like GitHub Actions). [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) is my agentic coding agent of [choice](https://lawwu.github.io/posts/2025-07-18-starting-to-use-claude-code/). I’m a curious learner who is fascinated with AI and its impact on work and society at large.

### Professional Experience
Currently, I'm a Principal Data Scientist at [UKG](https://www.ukg.com/){target="_blank"}, where I focus on applying AI to enhance workforce management solutions. My previous data science roles at [Medidata](https://www.medidata.com/){target="_blank"}, [PIMCO](https://www.pimco.com/){target="_blank"}, [Payoff](https://happymoney.com/){target="_blank"}, and [Allianz](https://allianz.com/){target="_blank"} have given me a diverse background across healthcare, finance, and insurance. Before transitioning to data science, I worked as an actuary.
