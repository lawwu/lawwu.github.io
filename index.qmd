## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Principal level ML/AI engineer who codes daily and ships reliable systems. Passionate about [MCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) and [A2A](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) as standard interfaces for AI; I build with Windsurf and [Claude Code](https://lawwu.github.io/posts/2025-07-18-starting-to-use-claude-code/). I enjoy building AI systems using common protocols like MCP, agent frameworks like [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) along with robust evals (that run in CI/CD like GitHub Actions). Iâ€™m a curious learner who is fascinated with AI and its impact on work and society at large.

### Professional Experience
Currently, I'm a Principal Data Scientist at [UKG](https://www.ukg.com/){target="_blank"}, where I focus on applying AI to enhance workforce management solutions. My previous data science roles at [Medidata](https://www.medidata.com/){target="_blank"}, [PIMCO](https://www.pimco.com/){target="_blank"}, [Payoff](https://happymoney.com/){target="_blank"}, and [Allianz](https://allianz.com/){target="_blank"} have given me a diverse background across healthcare, finance, and insurance. Before transitioning to data science, I worked as an actuary.
