 I am an experienced AI Engineer & Data Scientist who loves deriving insight and value from data. I enjoy building AI, Large Language Model (LLMs) and Machine Learning solutions that make a difference. Currently I'm a Principal Data Scientist at [UKG](https://www.ukg.com/). Prior to that, I've held data science positions at [Medidata](https://www.medidata.com/), [PIMCO](https://www.pimco.com/), [Payoff](https://happymoney.com/) and [Allianz](https://allianz.com/). Prior to getting into data science, I was an actuary.

On this site I keep a [technical blog](https://lawwu.github.io/blog.html), a [TIL](https://lawwu.github.io/til/) and resume. I also enjoy [running](https://lawwu.github.io/posts/2024-10-13-running-6-months/) and [writing about personal finance](https://lawwu.github.io/modest-money-guide/).

I am open for new consulting work and other engagements. If you are interested, you can [find more info here](https://doxasolutions.ai).
